It goes like this:
public static void main( String[] args ){
    Dog aDog = new Dog(""Max"");
    foo(aDog);

    if (aDog.getName().equals(""Max"")) { //true
        System.out.println( ""Java passes by value."" );

    } else if (aDog.getName().equals(""Fifi"")) {
        System.out.println( ""Java passes by reference."" );
    }
}

public static void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals(""Max""); // true

    d = new Dog(""Fifi"");
    d.getName().equals(""Fifi""); // true
}

In this example aDog.getName() will still return ""Max"". The value aDog within main is not overwritten in the function foo with the Dog ""Fifi"" as the object reference is passed by value. If it were passed by reference, then the aDog.getName() in main would return ""Fifi"" after the call to foo.
Likewise:
Dog aDog = new Dog(""Max"");
foo(aDog);
aDog.getName().equals(""Fifi""); // true
public void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals(""Max""); // true
    d.setName(""Fifi"");
}

In the above example, FiFi is the dog's name after call to foo(aDog). Any operations that foo performs on d are such that, for all practical purposes, they are performed on aDog itself (except d=new Dog(""Boxer"")).

73021,12541.0,2008-09-16T14:37:00Z,40480,1922,"I just noticed you referenced my article.
The Java Spec says that everything in Java is pass-by-value. There is no such thing as ""pass-by-reference"" in Java.
The key to understanding this is that something like
Dog myDog;

is not a Dog; it's actually a pointer to a Dog.
What that means, is when you have
Dog myDog = new Dog(""Rover"");
foo(myDog);

you're essentially passing the address of the created Dog object to the foo method.
(I say essentially because Java pointers aren't direct addresses, but it's easiest to think of them that way)
Suppose the Dog object resides at memory address 42. This means we pass 42 to the method.
if the Method were defined as
public void foo(Dog someDog) {
    someDog.setName(""Max"");     // AAA
    someDog = new Dog(""Fifi"");  // BBB
    someDog.setName(""Rowlf"");   // CCC
}

let's look at what's happening.

the parameter someDog is set to the value 42
at line ""AAA""


someDog is followed to the Dog it points to (the Dog object at address 42)
that Dog (the one at address 42) is asked to change his name to Max

at line ""BBB""


a new Dog is created. Let's say he's at address 74
we assign the parameter someDog to 74 

at line ""CCC""


someDog is followed to the Dog it points to (the Dog object at address 74)
that Dog (the one at address 74) is asked to change his name to Rowlf

then, we return

Now let's think about what happens outside the method:
Did myDog change?
There's the key.
Keeping in mind that myDog is a pointer, and not an actual Dog, the answer is NO. myDog still has the value 42; it's still pointing to the original Dog (but note that because of line ""AAA"", its name is now ""Max"" - still the same Dog; myDog's value has not changed.)
It's perfectly valid to follow an address and change what's at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.
Java works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.
In C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.
If Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the foo method we defined above would have changed where myDog was pointing when it assigned someDog on line BBB.
Think of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in. When that alias is assigned, so is the variable that was passed in.

I tend to simplify this with:

Then I can do:
StatusEnum MyStatus = EnumUtil.ParseEnum<StatusEnum>(""Active"");

One option suggested in the comments is to add an extension, which is simple enough:
public static T ToEnum<T>(this string value)
{
    return (T) Enum.Parse(typeof(T), value, true);
}

StatusEnum MyStatus = ""Active"".ToEnum<StatusEnum>();

Finally, you may want to have a default enum to use if the string cannot be parsed:

    {
        return defaultValue;

    T result;

Which makes this the call:
StatusEnum MyStatus = ""Active"".ToEnum(StatusEnum.None);

However, I would be careful adding an extension method like this to string as (without namespace control) it will appear on all instances of string whether they hold an enum or not (so 1234.ToString().ToEnum(StatusEnum.None) would be valid but nonsensical) .

Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are ""racing"" to access/change the data. 
Problems often occur when one thread does a ""check-then-act"" (e.g. ""check"" if the value is X, then ""act"" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the ""check"" and the ""act"". E.g:
if (x == 5) // The ""Check""
{
   y = x * 2; // The ""Act""

   // If another thread changed x in between ""if (x == 5)"" and ""y = x * 2"" above,
   // y will not be equal to 10.
}

The point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing.
In order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time. This would mean something like this:
// Obtain lock for x
if (x == 5)
{
   y = x * 2; // Now, nothing can change x until the lock is released.

A prototype for a function which takes a function parameter looks like the following:
void func ( void (*f)(int) );

This states that the parameter f will be a pointer to a function which has a void return type and which takes a single int parameter. The following function (print) is an example of a function which could be passed to func as a parameter because it is the proper type:
void print ( int x ) {
  printf(""%d\n"", x);
}

Function Call
When calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function. Use the function's name (without parentheses) for this:
func(print);

would call func, passing the print function to it.
Function Body
As with any parameter, func can now use the parameter's name in the function body to access the value of the parameter. Let's say that func will apply the function it is passed to the numbers 0-4. Consider, first, what the loop would look like to call print directly:
for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr < 5 ; ctr++ ) {
  print(ctr);
}

Since func's parameter declaration says that f is the name for a pointer to the desired function, we recall first that if f is a pointer then *f is the thing that f points to (i.e. the function print in this case). As a result, just replace every occurrence of print in the loop above with *f:
void func ( void (*f)(int) ) {
  for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr < 5 ; ctr++ ) {
    (*f)(ctr);

For the first case, you can use the Mono Migration Analyzer tool (Moma) to evaluate how far your application is from running on Mono.  If the evaluation comes back with flying colors, you should start on your testing and QA and get ready to ship.
If your evaluation comes back with a report highlighting features that are missing or differ significantly in their semantics in Mono you will have to evaluate whether the code can be adapted, rewritten or in the worst case whether your application can work with reduced functionality.      
According to our Moma statistics based on user submissions (this is from memory) about 50% of the applications work out of the box, about 25% require about a week worth of work (refactoring, adapting) another 15% require a serious commitment to redo chunks of your code, and the rest is just not worth bothering porting since they are so incredibly tied to Win32.   At that point, either you start from zero, or a business decision will drive the effort to make your code portable, but we are talking months worth of work (at least from the reports we have).
If you are starting from scratch, the situation is a lot simpler, because you will only be using the APIs that are present in Mono.   As long as you stay with the supported stack (which is pretty much .NET 2.0, plus all the core upgrades in 3.5 including LINQ and System.Core, plus any of the Mono cross-platform APIs) you will be fine.  
Every once in a while you might run into bugs in Mono or limitations, and you might have to work around them, but that is not different than any other system.
As for portability: ASP.NET applications are the easier ones to port, as those have little to no dependencies on Win32 and you can even use SQL server or other popular databases (there are plenty of bundled database providers with Mono).   
Windows.Forms porting is sometimes trickier because developers like to escape the .NET sandbox and P/Invoke their brains out to configure things as useful as the changing the cursor blinking rate expressed as two bezier points encoded in BCD form in a wParam.   Or some junk like that.

So how is it that anyone can be at all confused by this, and believe that Java is pass by reference, or think they have an example of Java acting as pass by reference? The key point is that Java never provides direct access to the values of objects themselves, in any circumstances. The only access to objects is through a reference to that object. Because Java objects are always accessed through a reference, rather than directly, it is common to talk about fields and variables and method arguments as being objects, when pedantically they are only references to objects. The confusion stems from this (strictly speaking, incorrect) change in nomenclature.
So, when calling a method

For primitive arguments (int, long, etc.), the pass by value is the actual value of the primitive (for example, 3).
For objects, the pass by value is the value of the reference to the object.

So if you have doSomething(foo) and public void doSomething(Foo foo) { .. } the two Foos have copied references that point to the same objects.
Naturally, passing by value a reference to an object looks very much like (and is indistinguishable in practice from) passing an object by reference.

Depending on how many standard library functions your runtime has, you may or not be able to use one of those.

AceUnit
AceUnit (Advanced C and Embedded Unit) bills itself as a comfortable C code unit test framework. It tries to mimick JUnit 4.x and includes reflection-like capabilities. AceUnit can be used in resource constraint environments, e.g. embedded software development, and importantly it runs fine in environments where you cannot include a single standard header file and cannot invoke a single standard C function from the ANSI / ISO C libraries. It also has a Windows port. It does not use forks to trap signals, although the authors have expressed interest in adding such a feature. See the AceUnit homepage.
GNU Autounit
Much along the same lines as Check, including forking to run unit tests in a separate address space (in fact, the original author of Check borrowed the idea from GNU Autounit). GNU Autounit uses GLib extensively, which means that linking and such need special options, but this may not be a big problem to you, especially if you are already using GTK or GLib. See the GNU Autounit homepage.
cUnit
Also uses GLib, but does not fork to protect the address space of unit tests.
CUnit
Standard C, with plans for a Win32 GUI implementation. Does not currently fork or otherwise protect the address space of unit tests. In early development. See the CUnit homepage.
CuTest
A simple framework with just one .c and one .h file that you drop into your source tree. See the CuTest homepage.
CppUnit
The premier unit testing framework for C++; you can also use it to test C code. It is stable, actively developed, and has a GUI interface. The primary reasons not to use CppUnit for C are first that it is quite big, and second you have to write your tests in C++, which means you need a C++ compiler. If these donât sound like concerns, it is definitely worth considering, along with other C++ unit testing frameworks. See the CppUnit homepage.
embUnit
embUnit (Embedded Unit) is another unit test framework for embedded systems. This one appears to be superseded by AceUnit. Embedded Unit homepage.
MinUnit
A minimal set of macros and thatâs it! The point is to show how easy it is to unit test your code. See the MinUnit homepage.
CUnit for Mr. Ando
A CUnit implementation that is fairly new, and apparently still in early development. See the CUnit for Mr. Ando homepage.
This list was last updated in March 2008.

Others:
CMocka
CMocka is a test framework for C with support for mock objects. It's easy to use and setup. CMocka official homepage.
Criterion
Criterion is a cross-platform C unit testing framework supporting automatic test registration, parameterized tests, theories, and that can output to multiple formats, including TAP and JUnit XML. Each test is run in its own process, so signals and crashes can be reported or tested if needed. See the Criterion homepage for more information.
HWUT
HWUT is a general Unit Test tool with great support for C. It can help to create Makefiles, generate massive test cases coded in minimal 'iteration tables', walk along state machines, generate C-stubs and more. The general approach is pretty unique: Verdicts are based on 'good stdout/bad stdout'. The comparison function, though, is flexible. Thus, any type of script may be used for checking. It may be applied to any language that can produce standard output. See HWUT homepage.

    if ( original.equals( """" ) ) {

if ( anotherCondition ) parameterString = appendWithDelimiter( parameterString, ""anotherElementName"", "","" );

I realize this isn't particularly efficient, since there are strings being created all over the place, but I was going for clarity more than optimization.
In Ruby, I can do something like this instead, which feels much more elegant:
parameterArray = [];
parameterArray << ""elementName"" if condition;
parameterArray << ""anotherElementName"" if anotherCondition;
parameterString = parameterArray.join("","");

43944,619.0,2008-09-04T15:03:25Z,43870,272,"Update as of PostgreSQL 9.0:
Recent versions of Postgres (since late 2010) have the string_agg(expression, delimiter) function that will do exactly what the question asked for, even letting you specify the delimiter string:
SELECT company_id, string_agg(employee, ', ')
FROM mytable
GROUP BY company_id;

Update as of PostgreSQL 8.4:
PostgreSQL 8.4 (in 2009) introduced the aggregate function array_agg(expression) which concatenates the values into an array. Then array_to_string() can be used to give the desired result:
SELECT company_id, array_to_string(array_agg(employee), ', ')
FROM mytable
GROUP BY company_id;

Original Answer (for pre-8.4 PostgreSQL):
There is no built-in aggregate function to concatenate strings. It seems like this would be needed, but it's not part of the default set. A web search however reveals some manual implementations the same example:
CREATE AGGREGATE textcat_all(
  basetype    = text,
  sfunc       = textcat,
  stype       = text,
  initcond    = ''
);

Here is the CREATE AGGREGATE documentation.
In order to get the "", "" inserted in between them without having it at the end, you might want to make your own concatenation function and substitute it for the ""textcat"" above. Here is one I put together but haven't tested (update: tested on 8.3.12 and working fine):
CREATE FUNCTION commacat(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF acc IS NULL OR acc = '' THEN
      RETURN instr;
    ELSE
      RETURN acc || ', ' || instr;
    END IF;
  END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

Note: The function above will output a comma even if the value in the row is null/empty, which outputs:
a, b, c, , e, , g

If you would prefer to remove extra commas to output:
a, b, c, e, g

just add an ELSIF check to the function:
CREATE FUNCTION commacat_ignore_nulls(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF acc IS NULL OR acc = '' THEN
      RETURN instr;
    ELSIF instr IS NULL OR instr = '' THEN
      RETURN acc;
    ELSE
      RETURN acc || ', ' || instr;

Functions that use pointers or
  references to base classes must be
  able to use objects of derived classes
  without knowing it.

At its heart LSP is about interfaces and contracts as well as how to decide when to extend a class vs. use another strategy such as composition to achieve your goal.
The most effective way I have seen to illustrate this point was in Head First OOA&D. They present a scenario where you are a developer on a project to build a framework for strategy games.
They present a class that represents a board that looks like this:

All of the methods take X and Y coordinates as parameters to locate the tile position in the two-dimensional array of Tiles. This will allow a game developer to manage units in the board during the course of the game.
The book goes on to change the requirements to say that the game frame work must also support 3D game boards to accommodate games that have flight. So a ThreeDBoard class is introduced that extends Board.
At first glance this seems like a good decision. Board provides both the Height and Width properties and ThreeDBoard provides the Z axis.
Where it breaks down is when you look at all the other members inherited from Board. The methods for AddUnit, GetTile, GetUnits and so on, all take both X and Y parameters in the Board class but the ThreeDBoard needs a Z parameter as well.
So you must implement those methods again with a Z parameter. The Z parameter has no context to the Board class and the inherited methods from the Board class lose their meaning. A unit of code attempting to use the ThreeDBoard class as its base class Board would be very out of luck.
Maybe we should find another approach. Instead of extending Board, ThreeDBoard should be composed of Board objects. One Board object per unit of the Z axis.
This allows us to use good object oriented principles like encapsulation and reuse and doesnât violate LSP.

43567,2676.0,2008-09-04T11:58:27Z,43320,213,"Briefly:

Always use transactions
Don't use Close(), instead wrap your calls on an ISession inside a using statement or manage the lifecycle of your ISession somewhere else.

From the documentation:

From time to time the ISession will execute the SQL statements needed to synchronize the ADO.NET connection's state with the state of objects held in memory. This process, flush, occurs by default at the following points

from some invocations of Find() or Enumerable()
from NHibernate.ITransaction.Commit()
from ISession.Flush() 

The SQL statements are issued in the following order

all entity insertions, in the same order the corresponding objects were saved using ISession.Save()
all entity updates
all collection deletions
all collection element deletions, updates and insertions
all collection insertions
all entity deletions, in the same order the corresponding objects were deleted using ISession.Delete()

(An exception is that objects using native ID generation are inserted when they are saved.)
Except when you explicity Flush(), there are absolutely no guarantees about when the Session executes the ADO.NET calls, only the order in which they are executed. However, NHibernate does guarantee that the ISession.Find(..) methods will never return stale data; nor will they return the wrong data.
It is possible to change the default behavior so that flush occurs less frequently. The FlushMode class defines three different modes: only flush at commit time (and only when the NHibernate ITransaction API is used), flush automatically using the explained routine, or never flush unless Flush() is called explicitly. The last mode is useful for long running units of work, where an ISession is kept open and disconnected for a long time.

...
Also refer to this section:

Ending a session involves four distinct phases:

flush the session
commit the transaction
close the session
handle exceptions 

Flushing the Session
If you happen to be using the ITransaction API, you don't need to worry about this step. It will be performed implicitly when the transaction is committed. Otherwise you should call ISession.Flush() to ensure that all changes are synchronized with the database.
Committing the database transaction
If you are using the NHibernate ITransaction API, this looks like:
tx.Commit(); // flush the session and commit the transaction

If you are managing ADO.NET transactions yourself you should manually Commit() the ADO.NET transaction.
sess.Flush();
currentTransaction.Commit();

If you decide not to commit your changes:
tx.Rollback();  // rollback the transaction

or:
currentTransaction.Rollback();

If you rollback the transaction you should immediately close and discard the current session to ensure that NHibernate's internal state is consistent.
Closing the ISession
A call to ISession.Close() marks the end of a session. The main implication of Close() is that the ADO.NET connection will be relinquished by the session.
tx.Commit();
sess.Close();

sess.Flush();
currentTransaction.Commit();
sess.Close();

If you provided your own connection, Close() returns a reference to it, so you can manually close it or return it to the pool. Otherwise Close() returns it to the pool.

Sometimes session.Close works, e.g., it commits all the changes that I need. I know I need to use commit when I have a transaction, or a unit of work with several creates/updates/deletes, so that I can choose to rollback if an error occurs.
But sometimes I really get stymied by the logic behind session.Flush. I have seen examples where you have a session.SaveOrUpdate() followed by a flush, but when I remove Flush it works fine anyway. Sometimes I run into errors on the Flush statement saying that the session timed out, and removing it made sure that I didn't run into that error.
Does anyone have a good guideline as to where or when to use a Flush? I've checked out the NHibernate documentation for this, but I still can't find a straightforward answer.

NOTE that this is a general look at stored procedures not regulated to a specific
  DBMS. Some DBMS (and even, different
  versions of the same DBMS!) may operate
  contrary to this, so you'll want to
  double-check with your target DBMS
  before assuming all of this still holds.
I've been a Sybase ASE, MySQL, and SQL Server DBA on-and off since for almost a decade (along with application development in C, PHP, PL/SQL, C#.NET, and Ruby). So, I have no particular axe to grind in this (sometimes) holy war.

The historical performance benefit of stored procs have generally been from the following (in no particular order):

Pre-parsed SQL
Pre-generated query execution plan
Reduced network latency
Potential cache benefits

Pre-parsed SQL -- similar benefits to compiled vs. interpreted code, except on a very micro level. 
Still an advantage? 
Not very noticeable at all on the modern CPU, but if you are sending a single SQL statement that is VERY large eleventy-billion times a second, the parsing overhead can add up.
Pre-generated query execution plan. 
If you have many JOINs the permutations can grow quite unmanageable (modern optimizers have limits and cut-offs for performance reasons). It is not unknown for very complicated SQL to have distinct, measurable (I've seen a complicated query take 10+ seconds just to generate a plan, before we tweaked the DBMS) latencies due to the optimizer trying to figure out the ""near best"" execution plan. Stored procedures will, generally, store this in memory so you can avoid this overhead.
Still an advantage? 
Most DBMS' (the latest editions) will cache the query plans for INDIVIDUAL SQL statements, greatly reducing the performance differential between stored procs and ad hoc SQL. There are some caveats and cases in which this isn't the case, so you'll need to test on your target DBMS.
Also, more and more DBMS allow you to provide optimizer path plans (abstract query plans) to significantly reduce optimization time (for both ad hoc and stored procedure SQL!!).

WARNING Cached query plans are not a performance panacea. Occasionally the query plan that is generated is sub-optimal.
  For example, if you send SELECT *
  FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND
  99999999, the DBMS may select a
  full-table scan instead of an index
  scan because you're grabbing every row
  in the table (so sayeth the
  statistics). If this is the cached
  version, then you can get poor
  performance when you later send
  SELECT * FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN
  1 AND 2. The reasoning behind this is
  outside the scope of this posting, but
  for further reading see:
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/frcqupln.mspx
  and
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181055.aspx
  and http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/performance/execution-plan-basics/
""In summary, they determined that
  supplying anything other than the
  common values when a compile or
  recompile was performed resulted in
  the optimizer compiling and caching
  the query plan for that particular
  value. Yet, when that query plan was
  reused for subsequent executions of
  the same query for the common values
  (âMâ, âRâ, or âTâ), it resulted in
  sub-optimal performance. This
  sub-optimal performance problem
  existed until the query was
  recompiled. At that point, based on
  the @P1 parameter value supplied, the
  query might or might not have a
  performance problem.""

Reduced network latency
A) If you are running the same SQL over and over -- and the SQL adds up to many KB of code -- replacing that with a simple ""exec foobar"" can really add up.
B) Stored procs can be used to move procedural code into the DBMS. This saves shuffling large amounts of data off to the client only to have it send a trickle of info back (or none at all!). Analogous to doing a JOIN in the DBMS vs. in your code (everyone's favorite WTF!)
Still an advantage?
A) Modern 1Gb (and 10Gb and up!) Ethernet really make this negligible. 
B) Depends on how saturated your network is -- why shove several megabytes of data back and forth for no good reason?
Potential cache benefits
Performing server-side transforms of data can potentially be faster if you have sufficient memory on the DBMS and the data you need is in memory of the server.
Still an advantage?
Unless your app has shared memory access to DBMS data, the edge will always be to stored procs.
Of course, no discussion of Stored Procedure optimization would be complete without a discussion of parameterized and ad hoc SQL.
Parameterized / Prepared SQL
Kind of a cross between stored procedures and ad hoc SQL, they are embedded SQL statements in a host language that uses ""parameters"" for query values, e.g.:
SELECT .. FROM yourtable WHERE foo = ? AND bar = ?

These provide a more generalized version of a query that modern-day optimizers can use to cache (and re-use) the query execution plan, resulting in much of the performance benefit of stored procedures.
Ad Hoc SQL
Just open a console window to your DBMS and type in a SQL statement. In the past, these were the ""worst"" performers (on average) since the DBMS had no way of pre-optimizing the queries as in the parameterized/stored proc method.
Still a disadvantage?
Not necessarily. Most DBMS have the ability to ""abstract"" ad hoc SQL into parameterized versions -- thus more or less negating the difference between the two. Some do this implicitly or must be enabled with a command setting (SQL server: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175037.aspx , Oracle: http://www.praetoriate.com/oracle_tips_cursor_sharing.htm).
Lessons learned?
Moore's law continues to march on and DBMS optimizers, with every release, get more sophisticated. Sure, you can place every single silly teeny SQL statement inside a stored proc, but just know that the programmers working on optimizers are very smart and are continually looking for ways to improve performance. Eventually (if it's not here already) ad hoc SQL performance will become indistinguishable (on average!) from stored procedure performance, so any sort of massive stored procedure use ** solely for ""performance reasons""** sure sounds like premature optimization to me.
Anyway, I think if you avoid the edge cases and have fairly vanilla SQL, you won't notice a difference between ad hoc and stored procedures.

I am pretty sure this is grounded in some historical context where this was once the case. Now, I'm not advocating that Stored Procs are not needed, but I want to know in what cases stored procs are necessary in modern databases such as MySql, SqlServer, Oracle, or . Is it overkill to have ALL access through stored procs?

Seriously.
Look at the things that are important: your project, your code, your job, your personal life. None of them are going to have their success rest on whether or not you use the ""this"" keyword to qualify access to fields. The this keyword will not help you ship on time. It's not going to reduce bugs, it's not going to have any appreciable effect on code quality or maintainability. It's not going to get you a raise, or allow you to spend less time at the office. 
It's really just a style issue. If you like ""this"", then use it. If you don't, then don't. If you need it to get correct semantics then use it. The truth is, every programmer has his own unique programing style. That style reflects that particular programmer's notions of what the ""most aesthetically pleasing code"" should look like. By definition, any other programmer who reads your code is going to have a different programing style. That means there is always going to be something you did that the other guy doesn't like, or would have done differently. At some point some guy is going to read your code and grumble about something. 
I wouldn't fret over it. I would just make sure the code is as aesthetically pleasing as possible according to your own tastes. If you ask 10 programmers how to format code, you are going to get about 15 different opinions. A better thing to focus on is how the code is factored. Are things abstracted right? Did I pick meaningful names for things? Is there a lot of code duplication? Are there ways I can simplify stuff? Getting those things right, I think, will have the greatest positive impact on your project, your code, your job, and your life. Coincidentally, it will probably also cause the other guy to grumble the least. If your code works, is easy to read, and is well factored, the other guy isn't going to be scrutinizing how you initialize fields. He's just going to use your code, marvel at it's greatness, and then move on to something else.

This book is many things, but you could say it's sort of a philosophical take on what it means to ""grok"" something.

Commentry from Garth Gilmore:
I credit this book with teaching me more about software development than any programming book I ever read.
The central thread in the book is how our romantic (artistic) and classical (technical/rational) perceptions of the world are both derived from how we perceive quality in the environment around us. This understanding is then applied to apparently mundane tasks like motorcycle maintenance.
To give some examples of how this applies to coding:

The section on how to approach the motorcycle with a 'quality mindset' that leads to progress is just as applicable to reaching 'the zone' in programming.
The section on 'gumption traps' that prevent progress and lead to you damaging the machine is priceless. The solutions that are presented work just as well when trying to modify legacy code without introducing bugs.
The section on how a purely classical description of an engine part is useless (because it lacks any place for the user to stand) should be read by anyone involved in requirements analysis.

Long story short its a good read :-)

Type safety: I think we all understand this.
Abstraction: This is especially true with LINQ-to-Entities.  This abstraction also allows the framework to add additional improvements that you can easily take advantage of.  PLINQ is an example of adding multi-threading support to LINQ.  Code changes are minimal to add this support.  It would be MUCH harder to do this data access code that simply calls sprocs.
Debugging support: I can use any .NET debugger to debug the queries.  With sprocs, you cannot easily debug the SQL and that experience is largely tied to your database vendor (MS SQL Server provides a query analyzer, but often that isn't enough).
Vendor agnostic: LINQ works with lots of databases and the number of supported databases will only increase.  Sprocs are not always portable between databases, either because of varying syntax or feature support (if the database supports sprocs at all).
Deployment: Others have mentioned this already, but it's easier to deploy a single assembly than to deploy a set of sprocs.  This also ties in with #4.
Easier: You don't have to learn T-SQL to do data access, nor do you have to learn the data access API (e.g. ADO.NET) necessary for calling the sprocs.  This is related to #3 and #4.

Some disadvantages of LINQ vs sprocs:

Network traffic: sprocs need only serialize sproc-name and argument data over the wire while LINQ sends the entire query.  This can get really bad if the queries are very complex.  However, LINQ's abstraction allows Microsoft to improve this over time.
Less flexible: Sprocs can take full advantage of a database's featureset.  LINQ tends to be more generic in it's support.  This is common in any kind of language abstraction (e.g. C# vs assembler).
Recompiling: If you need to make changes to the way you do data access, you need to recompile, version, and redeploy your assembly.  Sprocs can sometimes allow a DBA to tune the data access routine without a need to redeploy anything.

Security and manageability are something that people argue about too.

Security: For example, you can protect your sensitive data by restricting access to the tables directly, and put ACLs on the sprocs.  With LINQ, however, you can still restrict direct access  to tables and instead put ACLs on updatable table views to achieve a similar end (assuming your database supports updatable views).  
Manageability: Using views also gives you the advantage of shielding your application non-breaking from schema changes (like table normalization).  You can update the view without requiring your data access code to change.

I used to be a big sproc guy, but I'm starting to lean towards LINQ as a better alternative in general.  If there are some areas where sprocs are clearly better, then I'll probably still write a sproc but access it using LINQ. :)

Grouping of history

Mapping of trunk, branches, and tags
Subversive assumes the default svn layout: trunk, branches, tags (which you can change), so whenever you want to tag or branch it is one click and you provide the name of the tag or branch.
Like I said these are minor differences that I just find convenient. Both work great with mylyn, but overall there really isn't a whole lot of differences with these two extensions.

Specifically, I need to convert from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-15 and vice versa.
Everything goes: one-liners in your favorite scripting language, command-line tools or other utilities for OS, web sites, etc.
Best solutions so far:
On Linux/UNIX/OS X/cygwin:

Gnu iconv suggested by Troels Arvin is best used as a filter. It seems to be universally available. Example:
$ iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-15 in.txt > out.txt

As pointed out by Ben, there is an online converter using iconv.
Gnu recode (manual) suggested by Cheekysoft will convert one or several files in-place. Example:
$ recode UTF8..ISO-8859-15 in.txt

This one uses shorter aliases:
$ recode utf8..l9 in.txt

Recode also supports surfaces which can be used to convert between different line ending types and encodings:
Convert newlines from LF (Unix) to CR-LF (DOS):
$ recode ../CR-LF in.txt

Base64 encode file:
$ recode ../Base64 in.txt

You can also combine them.
Convert a Base64 encoded UTF8 file with Unix line endings to Base64 encoded Latin 1 file with Dos line endings:
$ recode utf8/Base64..l1/CR-LF/Base64 file.txt


On Windows with Powershell (Jay Bazuzi): 

PS C:\> gc -en utf8 in.txt | Out-File -en ascii out.txt
(No ISO-8859-15 support though; it says that supported charsets are unicode, utf7, utf8, utf32, ascii, bigendianunicode, default, and oem.)

Edit
Do you mean iso-8859-1 support? Using ""String"" does this e.g. for vice versa
gc -en string in.txt | Out-File -en utf8 out.txt

Note: The possible enumeration values are ""Unknown, String, Unicode, Byte, BigEndianUnicode, UTF8, UTF7, Ascii"".

This is VM specific, but normally a VM stores a bunch of pointers to native resources in private fields (e.g. a pointer to the native thread object is stored in a long field in java.lang.Thread). Just change them via reflection and the VM will crash sooner or later.

So in this case, instantiation is almost an order of magnitude faster for the tuple, but item access is actually somewhat faster for the list! So if you're creating a few tuples and accessing them many many times, it may actually be faster to use lists instead.

34745,2570347.0,2008-08-29T17:01:56Z,34510,121,"A ""race condition"" exists when multithreaded (or otherwise parallel) code that would access a shared resource could do so in such a way as to cause unexpected results.
Take this example:
for ( int i = 0; i < 10000000; i++ )
{
   x = x + 1; 
}

If you had 5 threads executing this code at once, the value of x WOULD NOT end up being 50,000,000.  It would in fact vary with each run.
This is because, in order for each thread to increment the value of x, they have to do the following: (simplified, obviously)

Retrieve the value of x
Add 1 to this value
Store this value to x

Any thread can be at any step in this process at any time, and they can step on each other when a shared resource is involved.  The state of x can be changed by another thread during the time between x is being read and when it is written back.
Let's say a thread retrieves the value of x, but hasn't stored it yet.  Another thread can also retrieve the same value of x (because no thread has changed it yet) and then they would both be storing the same value (x+1) back in x!
Example:

Thread 1: reads x, value is 7
Thread 1: add 1 to x, value is now 8
Thread 2: reads x, value is 7
Thread 1: stores 8 in x
Thread 2: adds 1 to x, value is now 8
Thread 2: stores 8 in x

Race conditions can be avoided by employing some sort of locking mechanism before the code that accesses the shared resource:
for ( int i = 0; i < 10000000; i++ )
{
   //lock x
   x = x + 1; 
   //unlock x
}

Here, the answer comes out as 50,000,000 every time.

Accept the most basic type that will work
Return the richest type your user will need

So when writing a function or method that takes a collection, write it not to take a List, but an IList<T>, an ICollection<T>, or IEnumerable<T>.  The generic interfaces will still work even for heterogenous lists because System.Object can be a T too.  Doing this will save you headache if you decide to use a Stack or some other data structure further down the road.  If all you need to do in the function is foreach through it, IEnumerable<T> is really all you should be asking for.
On the other hand, when returning an object out of a function, you want to give the user the richest possible set of operations without them having to cast around.  So in that case, if it's a List<T> internally, return a copy as a List<T>.

The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed

While this is true and has been observed by other people (take Stepanov, inventor of the STL), the rest is nonsense. OOP may be flawed and it certainly is no silver bullet but it makes large-scale applications much simpler because it's a great way to reduce dependencies. Of course, this is only true for âgoodâ OOP design. Sloppy design won't give any advantage. But good, decoupled design can be modelled very well using OOP and not well using other techniques.
There are much better, more universal models (Haskell's type model comes to mind) but these are also often more complicated and/or difficult to implement efficiently. OOP is a good trade-off between extremes.
",24270,2131.0,2008-08-23T14:40:28Z,,126,What's the point of OOP?,"As far as I can tell, in spite of the countless millions or billions spent on OOP education, languages, and tools, OOP has not improved developer productivity or software reliability, nor has it reduced development costs. Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).
So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?

An X copy is ""physically"" highlighting text with the mouse cursor.
An Emacs paste is the command yank (usually bound to C-y).
A system paste is what you typically get from pressing C-v (or choosing ""Edit-Paste"" in an application window).
An X paste is pressing the ""center mouse button"" (simulated by pressing the left and right mouse buttons together).

In my case (on GNOME):

Both Emacs and system copy usually work with X paste.
X copy usually works with Emacs paste.
To make system copy work with Emacs paste and Emacs copy work with system paste, you need to add (setq x-select-enable-clipboard t) to your .emacs. Or try 
META-X set-variable RET x-select-enable-clipboard RET t


I think this is pretty standard modern Unix behavior.
It's also important to note (though you say you're using Emacs in a separate window) that when Emacs is running in a console, it is completely divorced from the system and X clipboards: cut and paste in that case is mediated by the terminal. For example, ""Edit->Paste"" in your terminal window should act exactly as if you typed the text from the clipboard into the Emacs buffer.

Good Tests should be A TRIP (The acronymn isn't sticky enough - I have a printout of the cheatsheet in the book that I had to pull out to make sure I got this right..)

Automatic : Invoking of tests as well as checking results for PASS/FAIL should be automatic
Thorough: Coverage; Although bugs tend to cluster around certain regions in the code, ensure that you test all key paths and scenarios.. Use tools if you must to know untested regions
Repeatable: Tests should produce the same results each time.. every time. Tests should not rely on uncontrollable params.
Independent: Very important. 

Tests should test only one thing at a time. Multiple assertions are okay as long as they are all testing one feature/behavior. When a test fails, it should pinpoint the location of the problem.
Tests should not rely on each other - Isolated. No assumptions about order of test execution. Ensure 'clean slate' before each test by using setup/teardown appropriately

Professional: In the long run you'll have as much test code as production (if not more), therefore follow the same standard of good-design for your test code. Well factored methods-classes with intention-revealing names, No duplication, tests with good names, etc. 
Good tests also run Fast. any test that takes over half a second to run.. needs to be worked upon. The longer the test suite takes for a run.. the less frequently it will be run. The more changes the dev will try to sneak between runs.. if anything breaks.. it will take longer to figure out which change was the culprit.

Update 2010-08:

Readable : This can be considered part of Professional - however it can't be stressed enough. An acid test would be to find someone who isn't part of your team and asking him/her to figure out the behavior under test within a couple of minutes. Tests need to be maintained just like production code - so make it easy to read even if it takes more effort. Tests should be symmetric (follow a pattern) and concise (test one behavior at a time). Use a consistent naming convention (e.g. the TestDox style). Avoid cluttering the test with ""incidental details"".. become a minimalist.

Apart from these, most of the others are guidelines that cut down on low-benefit work: e.g. 'Don't test code that you don't own' (e.g. third-party DLLs). Don't go about testing getters and setters. Keep an eye on cost-to-benefit ratio or defect probability.

You need to more than just a simple get/set - in this case, you should just avoid using automatic properties for this member.
You want to avoid the performance hit of going through the get or set and just use the member directly - in this case, I'd be surprised if there really was a performance hit. The simple get/set members are very very easy to inline, and in my (admittedly limited) testing I haven't found a difference between using the automatic properties and accessing the member directly. 
You only want to have public read access (i.e. just a 'get') and the class write to the member directly - in this case, you can use a private set in your automatic property. i.e.
public class MyClass
{
    public int Age {get; private set;}

Question Two :
  Do you see yourself wanting to frequently switch the format of your logging output? Will you need an easy, flexible way to do so? In other words, do you need Log4j's PatternLayout?
Question Three :
  Do you anticipate a definite need for the ability to change complex logging configurations in your applications, after they are compiled and deployed in a production environment?

Then, connect to the remote machine you want to login to, to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys add the contents of your that id_rsa.pub file.

pychecker: It crashes frequently, most of the runs I tried resulted in Errors that originated in the pychecker code (eg: AttributeError or IndexError: list index out of range were the most common).  For some reason I had to set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable before it would even run on any of the app code, and the documentation is very sparse.
pyflakes: 'pyflakes --help' throws a TypeError -- erm... Documentation is also very sparse, and pyflakes is very forgiving (as far as I can tell, it only reports compile errors, warnings, redefinitions, and some concerns about imports--such as unused and wildcards).  pyflakes also seems to repeat itself:

eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused
      eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused
      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used; unable to detect undefined names

pylint: This seems to be the most capable of the tools suggested.  It has the best documentation.  LogiLab provides a tutorial, pylint has a help screen, and there is a (broken) link to a user manual, which would be extremely helpful.  There are some issues with applying pylint to django, since pylint doesn't know about the django classes (such as models.Model).  This means that a fair number of otherwise valuable errors are generated about missing class fields.  eg:

E:105:get_events_by_tag: Class 'Tag' has no 'objects' member

Parsing these out automatically will be very difficult without some additional knowledge of the classes in use.  I'm not sure adding that is feasible, but it does seem likely that pylint is capable of dealing with this in the ""right"" way.  (I probably just need to point it to the django source, but there are no command line params that look likely, and, as mentioned earlier, the user manual is inaccessible.)

To avoid this unpleasantness I would recommend that you typedef the function pointer into something more readable. For example.

Declares a function that returns void and takes no arguments. To create a function pointer to this type you can now do:
void dosomething() { }

functiontype func = &dosomething;
func();

For a function that returns an int and takes a char you would do
typedef int (*functiontype2)(char);

and to use it
int dosomethingwithchar(char a) { return 1; }

functiontype2 func2 = &dosomethingwithchar
int result = func2('a');

There are libraries that can help with turning function pointers into nice readable types. The boost function library is great and is well worth the effort!

44357,4410.0,2008-09-04T18:07:31Z,3260,79,"There are lots and lots of classic peak detection methods, any of which might work.  You'll have to see what, in particular, bounds the quality of your data.  Here are basic descriptions:

Between any two points in your data, (x(0),y(0)) and (x(n),y(n)), add up y(i+1)-y(i) for 0 <= i < n and call this T (""travel"") and set R (""rise"") to y(n)- y(0) + k for suitably small k.  T/R > 1 indicates a peak.  This works OK if large travel due to noise is unlikely or if noise distributes symmetrically around a base curve shape.  For your application, accept the earliest peak with a score above a given threshold, or analyze the curve of travel per rise values for more interesting properties.
Use matched filters to score similarity to a standard peak shape (essentially, use a normalized dot-product against some shape to get a cosine-metric of similarity)
Deconvolve against a standard peak shape and check for high values (though I often find 2 to be less sensitive to noise for simple instrumentation output).
Smooth the data and check for triplets of equally spaced points where, if x0 < x1 < x2, y1 > 0.5*(y0+y2), or check Euclidean distances like this:  D((x0,y0),(x1,y1)) + D((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) > D((x0,y0),(x2,y2)), which relies on the triangle inequality.  Using simple ratios will again provide you a scoring mechanism.
Fit a very simple 2-gaussian mixture model to your data (for example, Numerical Recipes has a nice ready-made chunk of code).  Take the earlier peak.  This will deal correctly with overlapping peaks.
Find the best match in the data to a simple Gaussian, Cauchy, Poisson, or what-have-you curve.  Evaluate this curve over a broad range and subtract it from a copy of the data after noting it's peak location.  Repeat.  Take the earliest peak whose model parameters (standard deviation probably, but some applications might care about kurtosis or other features) meet some criterion.  Watch out for artifacts left behind when peaks are subtracted from the data.
Best match might be determined by the kind of match scoring suggested in #2 above.

I've done what you're doing before:  finding peaks in DNA sequence data, finding peaks in derivatives estimated from measured curves, and finding peaks in histograms.
I encourage you to attend carefully to proper baselining.  Wiener filtering or other filtering or simple histogram analysis is often an easy way to baseline in the presence of noise.
Finally, if your data is typically noisy and you're getting data off the card as unreferenced single-ended output (or even referenced, just not differential), and if you're averaging lots of observations into each data point, try sorting those observations and throwing away the first and last quartile and averaging what remains.  There are a host of such outlier elimination tactics that can be really useful.
",3260,186.0,2008-08-06T10:23:18Z,,46,Peak detection of measured signal,"We use a data acquisition card to take readings from a device that increases its signal to a peak and then falls back to near the original value. To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations.
This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.
My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?

84943,16219.0,2008-09-17T16:17:05Z,84340,78,"A lot of times some quick task comes up that isn't part of the main software you are developing.  Sometimes the task is one off ie compare this file to the database and let me know the differences.  It is a lot easier to do text parsing in Perl/Ruby/Python than it is in Java or C# (partially because it is a lot easier to use regular expressions).  It will probably take a lot less time to parse the text file using Perl/Ruby/Python (or maybe even vbscript cringe and then load it into the database than it would to create a Java/C# program to do it or to do it by hand.
Also, due to the ease at which most of the dynamic languages parse text, they are great for code generation.  Sure your final project must be in C#/Java/Transact SQL but instead of cutting and pasting 100 times, finding errors, and cutting and pasting another 100 times it is often (but not always) easier just to use a code generator.
A recent example at work is we needed to get data from one accounting system into our accounting system.  The system has an import format, but the old system had a completely different format (fixed width although some things had to be matched).  The task is not to create a program to migrate the data over and over again.  It is to shove the data into our system and then maintain it there going forward.  So even though we are a C# and SQL Server shop, I used Python to convert the data into the format that could be imported by our application.  Ultimately it doesn't matter that I used python, it matters that the data is in the system.  My boss was pretty impressed.
Where I often see the dynamic languages used for is testing.  It is much easier to create a Python/Perl/Ruby program to link to a web service and throw some data against it than it is to create the equivalent Java program.  You can also use python to hit against command line programs, generate a ton of garbage (but still valid) test data, etc.. quite easily.
The other thing that dynamic languages are big on is code generation.  Creating the C#/C++/Java code.  Some examples follow:
The first code generation task I often see is people using dynamic languages to maintain constants in the system.  Instead of hand coding a bunch of enums, a dynamic language can be used to fairly easily parse a text file and create the Java/C# code with the enums.
SQL is a whole other ball game but often you get better performance by cut and pasting 100 times instead of trying to do a function (due to caching of execution plans or putting complicated logic in a function causing you to go row by row instead of in a set).  In fact it is quite useful to use the table definition to create certain stored procedures automatically.
It is always better to get buy in for a code generator.  But even if you don't, is it more fun to spend time cutting/pasting or is it more fun to create a Perl/Python/Ruby script once and then have that generate the code?  If it takes you hours to hand code something but less time to create a code generator, then even if you use it once you have saved time and hence money.  If it takes you longer to create a code generator than it takes to hand code once but you know you will have to update the code more than once, it may still make sense.  If it takes you 2 hours to hand code, 4 hours to do the generator but you know you'll have to hand code equivalent work another 5 or 6 times than it is obviously better to create the generator.
Also some things are easier with dynamic languages than Java/C#/C/C++.  In particular regular expressions come to mind.  If you start using regular expressions in Perl and realize their value, you may suddenly start making use of the Java regular expression library if you haven't before.  If you have then there may be something else.
I will leave you with one last example of a task that would have been great for a dynamic language.  My work mate had to take a directory full of files and burn them to various cd's for various customers.  There were a few customers but a lot of files and you had to look in them to see what they were.  He did this task by hand....A Java/C# program would have saved time, but for one time and with all the development overhead it isn't worth it.  However slapping something together in Perl/Python/Ruby probably would have been worth it.  He spent several hours doing it.  It would have taken less than one to create the Python script to inspect each file, match which customer it goes to, and then move the file to the appropriate place.....Again, not part of the standard job.  But the task came up as a one off.  Is it better to do it yourself, spend the larger amount of time to make Java/C# do the task, or spend a much smaller amount of time doing it in Python/Perl/Ruby.  If you are using C or C++ the point is even more dramatic due to the extra concerns of programming in C or C++ (pointers, no array bounds checking, etc.).

The link that appears to be most promising (www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles) is no longer available, so you'll need to poke through the Archive.org version to read it.
At the end of the day the bootloader takes the machine code of the kernel, puts it in memory, and jumps to it.  You can put any machine code in the kernel that you want, but most C programs expect an OS so you'll need to tell your compiler that it won't have all that, or the bootloader has to create some of it.
The kernel then does all the heavy lifting, and I suspect it's the example kernel you want.  But there's a long way to go between having a kernel that says, ""Hello world"" to having a kernel that loads a command interpretor, provides disk services, and loads and manages programs.
You might want to consider subscribing to ACM to get access to their older literature - there are lots of articles in the late 80's and early 90's in early computing magazines about how to create alternative OSs.

You might be able to get the same information for free by looking up the indexes of those magazines (which are available on that site - click ""index"" near the magazine name) and then asking around for people with a copy.

When data is produced and not (immediately) consumed again, the fact that memory store operations read a full cache line first and then modify the cached data is detrimental to performance. This operation pushes data out of the caches which might be needed again in favor of data which will not be used soon. This is especially true for large data structures, like matrices, which are filled and then used later. Before the last element of the matrix is filled the sheer size evicts the first elements, making caching of the writes ineffective.
For this and similar situations, processors provide support for non-temporal write operations. Non-temporal in this context means the data will not be reused soon, so there is no reason to cache it. These non-temporal write operations do not read a cache line and then modify it; instead, the new content is directly written to memory.

But keep a few things in mind when making this decision: using any ORM couples you tightly to your data model.  A DBA has no freedom to make changes to the data model without forcing you to change your compiled code.  With stored procedures, you can hide these sorts of changes to an extent, since the parameter list and results set(s) returned from a procedure represent its contract, and the innards can be changed around, just so long as that contract is still met.
And also, if Linq is used for more complex queries, tuning the database becomes a much more difficult task.  When a stored procedure is running slow, the DBA can totally focus on the code in isolation, and has lots of options, just so that contract is still satisfied when he/she is done.
I have seen many, many cases where serious problems in an application were addressed by changes to the schema and code in stored procedures without any change to deployed, compiled code.
Perhaps a hybird approach would be nice with Linq?  Linq can, of course, be used to call stored procedures.

    int getWidth() const;

Now we have a problem although the interface matches. The reason is that we have violated invariants stemming from the mathematical definition of squares and rectangles. The way getters and setters work, a Rectangle should satisfy the following invariant:
void invariant(Rectangle& r) {
    r.setHeight(200);
    r.setWidth(100);
    assert(r.getHeight() == 200 and r.getWidth() == 100);

Create a new project in XCode. I think I used the view-based app.
Drag a WebView object onto your interface and resize.
Inside of your WebViewController.m (or similarly named file, depending on the name of your view), in the viewDidLoad method:
NSString *filePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""index"" ofType:@""html""];  
NSData *htmlData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:filePath];  
if (htmlData) {  
  NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle]; 
  NSString *path = [bundle bundlePath];
  NSString *fullPath = [NSBundle pathForResource:@""index"" ofType:@""html"" inDirectory:path];
  [webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:fullPath]]];
}
Now any files you have added as resources to the project are available for use in your web app. I've got an index.html file including javascript and css and image files with no problems. The only limitation I've found so far is that I can't create new folders so all the files clutter up the resources folder.
Trick: make sure you've added the file as a resource in XCode or the file won't be available. I've been adding an empty file in XCode, then dragging my file on top in the finder. That's been working for me.

Note: I realize that Obj-C must not be that hard to learn. But since I already have this app existing in JS and I know it works in Safari this is a much faster dev cycle for me. Some day I'm sure I'll have to break down and learn Obj-C.

49512,5168.0,2008-09-08T11:33:41Z,49510,70,"There are four steps to making an app that can act as the default web browser. The first three steps allow your app to act as a role handler for the relevant URL schemes (HTTP and HTTPS) and the final step makes it the default role handler for those schemes.
1) Add the URL schemes your app can handle to your application's info.plist file
To add support for http:// and https:// you'd need to add the following to your application's info.plist file. This tells the OS that your application is capable of handling HTTP and HTTP URLs.
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>http URL</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>

            <string>http</string>

    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>Secure http URL</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>https</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>

2) Write an URL handler method
This method will be called by the OS when it wants to use your application to open a URL. It doesn't matter which object you add this method to, that'll be explicitly passed to the Event Manager in the next step. The URL handler method should look something like this:
- (void)getUrl:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)event 
    withReplyEvent:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)replyEvent
{
  // Get the URL
  NSString *urlStr = [[event paramDescriptorForKeyword:keyDirectObject] 
    stringValue];

  //TODO: Your custom URL handling code here
}

3) Register the URL handler method
Next, tell the event manager which object and method to call when it wants to use your app to load an URL. In the code here I'm passed self as the event handler, assuming that we're calling setEventHandler from the same object that defines the getUrl:withReplyEvent: method.
You should add this code somewhere in your application's initialisation code.
NSAppleEventManager *em = [NSAppleEventManager sharedAppleEventManager];
[em 
  setEventHandler:self 
  andSelector:@selector(getUrl:withReplyEvent:) 
  forEventClass:kInternetEventClass 
  andEventID:kAEGetURL];

Some applications, including early versions of Adobe AIR, use the alternative WWW!/OURL AppleEvent to request that an application opens URLs, so to be compatible with those applications you should also add the following:
[em
  setEventHandler:self 
  andSelector:@selector(getUrl:withReplyEvent:) 
  forEventClass:'WWW!' 
  andEventID:'OURL'];

4) Set your app as the default browser
Everything we've done so far as told the OS that your application is a browser, now we need to make it the default browser.
We've got to use the Launch Services API to do this. In this case we're setting our app to be the default role handler for HTTP and HTTPS links:
CFStringRef bundleID = (CFStringRef)[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier];
OSStatus httpResult = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(CFSTR(""http""), bundleID);
OSStatus httpsResult = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(CFSTR(""https""), bundleID);
//TODO: Check httpResult and httpsResult for errors

(It's probably best to ask the user's permission before changing their default browser.)
Custom URL schemes
It's worth noting that you can also use these same steps to handle your own custom URL schemes. If you're creating a custom URL scheme it's a good idea to base it on your app's bundle identifier to avoid clashes with other apps. So if your bundle ID is com.example.MyApp you should consider using x-com-example-myapp:// URLs.

Using namespace
Namespaces are used at the very least to help avoid name collision. In Java, this is enforced through the ""org.domain"" idiom (because it is supposed one won't use anything else than his/her own domain name).
In C++, you could give a namespace to all the code in your module. For example, for a module MyModule.dll, you could give its code the namespace MyModule. I've see elsewhere someone using MyCompany::MyProject::MyModule. I guess this is overkill, but all in all, it seems correct to me.
Using ""using""
Using should be used with great care because it effectively import one (or all) symbols from a namespace into your current namespace.
This is evil to do it in a header file because your header will pollute every source including it (it reminds me of macros...), and even in a source file, bad style outside a function scope because it will import at global scope the symbols from the namespace.
The most secure way to use ""using"" is to  import select symbols:
void doSomething()
{
   using std::string ; // string is now ""imported"", at least,
                       // until the end of the function
   string a(""Hello World"") ;
   std::cout << a << endl ;
}

void doSomethingElse()
{
   using namespace std ; // everything from std is now ""imported"", at least,
                       // until the end of the function
   string a(""Hello World"") ;
   cout << a << endl ;
}

You'll see a lot of ""using namespace std ;"" in tutorial or example codes. The reason is to reduce the number of symbols to make the reading easier, not because it is a good idea.
""using namespace std ;"" is discouraged by Scott Meyers (I don't remember exactly which book, but I can find it if necessary).
Namespace Composition
Namespaces are more than packages. Another example can be found in Bjarne Stroustrup's ""The C++ Programming Language"".
In the ""Special Edition"", at 8.2.8 Namespace Composition, he describes how you can merge two namespaces AAA and BBB into another one called CCC. Thus CCC becomes an alias for both AAA and BBB:
namespace AAA
{
   void doSomething() ;
}

namespace BBB
{
   void doSomethingElse() ;
}

namespace CCC
{
   using namespace AAA ;
   using namespace BBB ;
}

void doSomethingAgain()
{
   CCC::doSomething() ;
   CCC::doSomethingElse() ;
}

You could even import select symbols from different namespaces, to build your own custom namespace interface. I have yet to find a practical use of this, but in theory, it is cool.

ignoring pronouns is done via a stoplist.
preserving proper nouns? You mean, detecting named entities, like Hoover Dam and saying ""it's one word"" or compound nouns, like programming language? I'll give you a hint: that's tough one, but there exist libraries for both. Look for NER (Named entitiy recognition) and lexical chunking. OpenNLP is a Java-Toolkit that does both.
ignoring hyphenation? You mean, like at line breaks? Use regular expressions and verify the resulting word via dictionary lookup.
handling plurals/stemming: you can look into the Snowball stemmer. It does the trick nicely.
""grouping"" adjectives with their nouns is generally a task of shallow parsing. But if you are looking specifically for qualitative adjectives (good, bad, shitty, amazing...) you may be interested in sentiment analysis. LingPipe does this, and a lot more.

I'm sorry, I know you said you wanted to KISS, but unfortunately, your demands aren't that easy to meet. Nevertheless, there exist tools for all of this, and you should be able to just tie them together and not have to perform any task yourself, if you don't want to. If you want to perform a task yourself, I suggest you look at stemming, it's the easiest of all.
If you go with Java, combine Lucene with the OpenNLP toolkit. You will get very good results, as Lucene already has a stemmer built in and a lot of tutorial. The OpenNLP toolkit on the other hand is poorly documented, but you won't need too much out of it. You might also be interested in NLTK, written in Python.
I would say you drop your last requirement, as it involves shallow parsing and will definetly not impove your results.

Answers
Both mp3split and ffmpeg are both good solutions. I chose ffmpeg as it is commonly installed on linux servers and is also easily available for windows.  Here's some more good command line parameters for generating previews with ffmpeg

-t <seconds> chop after specified number of seconds
-y force file overwrite
-ab <bitrate> set bitrate e.g. -ab 96k
-ar <rate Hz> set sampling rate e.g. -ar 22050 for 22.05kHz

a lot of people use it so it's easy to get help, 
can integrate with most of IDEs i.e. Visual Studio (i.e. ankhsvn or VisualSVN -- more info) or Eclipse (i.e. Subclipse -- here someone asked about that).

You don't lost your source control repositories if your development box dies.
You don't have to worry about maintenance of one more box.

There are companies which host SVN repositories.
Here are links to SVN (client and server) packages for various operating systems.
Disadvantages of SVN
I am using SVN on Windows machine for about 5 years and found that SVN has a few disadvantages :).
It is slow on large repositories
SVN (or its client -- TortoiseSVN) has one big disadvantage -- it terrible slow (while updating or committing) on large (thousands of files) repositories unless you have SSD drive.
Merging can be difficult
Many people complain about how hard merging is with SVN.
I do merging for about 4 years (including about 2 years in CVS -- that was terrible, but doable) and about 2 years with SVN.
And personally I don't find it hard -- on the other hand -- any merge is easy after merging branches in CVS :).
I do merge of large repository (two repositories in fact) once a week and rarely I have conflicts which are hard to solve (most of conflicts are solved automatically with diff software which I use).
However in case of project of a few developers merging should not be problem at all if you keep a few simple rules:

merge changes often,
avoid active development in various branches simultaneously.

Added in July 2011
Many devs recommended Distributed Version Control like Git or Mercurial.
From single developer perspective there are only a few important advantages of DVCS over SVN:

DVCS can be faster.
You can commit to local repository without access to central one.
DVCS is hot thing and fancy to use/learn (if someone pay for your learning).

And I don't think merging is a problem in case of single developer.
Joel Spolsky wrote tutorial about Mercurial which is definitively worth to read.
So, despite of many advantages of DVCS I would stay with SVN if merging or speed is not a problem.
Or try Mercurial, which according to this and this SO questions, is better supported (in July 2011) on Windows.
Added in July 2014
For about a year I use Git (Git Bash mainly) for my pet-projects (i.e. solving Euler problems) and local branches for each Euler problem are really nice feature -- exactly as it is described as advantage of DVCS. 
Today Git tooling on Windows is much, much better then 2 or more years ago.
You can use remote repo (like GitHub or ProjectLocker and many others) to keep 
copy of your project away from your workstation with no extra effort/money.
However I use GUI client only to looks at diffs (and sometimes to choose files to commit),
so it's better to not afraid of command line -- it's really nice.

79845,13940.0,2008-09-17T04:02:23Z,4080,60,"For static analysis tools I often use CPD, PMD, FindBugs, and Checkstyle.
CPD is the PMD ""Copy/Paste Detector"" tool. I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the ""Finding Duplicated Code"" link on the PMD web page.
I'd like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their ""out-of-the-box"" set of rules. And not just because they're open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or ""hooks"" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the ""designer"" tool that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the DescendantToken check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.
I integrate these tools with an Ant-based build. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.
In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat ""integrated"" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the ""static-analysis"" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a ""unified"" solution? (I've asked this question separately here)
First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:
/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message
This is often called the ""Emacs format,"" but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:
/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.
My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant filterchains.
The second ""integration"" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write ""SuppressWarning?""
For example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string ""NOPMD"" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's @SuppressWarnings annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing ""SuppressWarning(PMD."" instead of NOPMD so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:
// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained
Only the ""SuppressWarnings(PMD."" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the @SuppressWarning annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:
@SuppressWarnings(""PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals"") // justification: identity comparision intended
Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings CHECKSTYLE:OFF and CHECKSTYLE:ON, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's ""SuppressionCommentFilter"") to use the strings ""BEGIN SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle."" and ""END SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle."" makes the controls look more like PMD:

// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: ""Effective Java,"" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2
// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)

With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (HiddenField) is significant because each check has its own ""BEGIN/END"" comment pair.
FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a @SuppressWarnings annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom @SuppressWarnings annotation because the built-in Java @SuppressWarnings annotation has a SOURCE retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's @SuppressWarnings annotation:
@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(""UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR"")
These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string ""SuppressWarnings"" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.

If you have a Berkley DB backend, if you're not sure of what your backend is, or if you're changing SVN version numbers, you're going to want to use svnadmin to dump your old repository and load it into your new repository.  Using svnadmin dump will give you a single file backup that you can copy to the new system.  Then you can create the new (empty) repository and use svnadmin load, which will essentially replay all the commits along with its metadata (author, timestamp, etc).
You can read more about the dump/load process here:
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate
Also, if you do svnadmin load, make sure you use the --force-uuid option, or otherwise people are going to have problems switching to the new repository.  Subversion uses a UUID to identify the repository internally, and it won't let you switch a working copy to a different repository.
If you don't have filesystem access, there may be other third party options out there (or you can write something) to help you migrate: essentially you'd have to use the svn log to replay each revision on the new repository, and then fix up the metadata afterwards.  You'll need the pre-revprop-change and post-revprop-change hook scripts in place to do this, which sort of assumes filesystem access, so YMMV.  Or, if you don't want to keep the history, you can use your working copy to import into the new repository.  But hopefully this isn't the case.

When should the lock be used?

A lock should be used to protect shared resources in multithreaded code.  Not for anything else.

But is it necessary when the application does not spin off any other threads?

Absolutely not.  It's just a time waster.  However do be sure that you're not implicitly using system threads.  For example if you use asynchronous I/O you may receive callbacks from a random thread, not your original thread.

Is there performance issues with using lock?

Yes.  They're not very big in a single-threaded application, but why make calls you don't need?

...if that is a good design pattern to follow in the future[?]

Locking everything willy-nilly is a terrible design pattern.  If your code is cluttered with random locking and then you do decide to use a background thread for some work, you're likely to run into deadlocks.  Sharing a resource between multiple threads requires careful design, and the more you can isolate the tricky part, the better.

If your build uses custom tasks, they should still work if they don't depend on Windows executables (such as rmdir or xcopy).

30818,3271.0,2008-08-27T18:30:47Z,30710,56,"I would suggest mocking out your calls to the database.  Mocks are basically objects that look like the object you are trying to call a method on, in the sense that they have the same properties, methods, etc. available to caller.  But instead of performing whatever action they are programmed to do when a particular method is called, it skips that altogether, and just returns a result. That result is typically defined by you ahead of time.  
In order to set up your objects for mocking, you probably need to use some sort of inversion of control/ dependency injection pattern, as in the following pseudo-code:
class Bar
{
    private FooDataProvider _dataProvider;

    public instantiate(FooDataProvider dataProvider) {
        _dataProvider = dataProvider;
    }

    public getAllFoos() {
        // instead of calling Foo.GetAll() here, we are introducing an extra layer of abstraction
        return _dataProvider.GetAllFoos();
    }
}

class FooDataProvider
{
    public Foo[] GetAllFoos() {
        return Foo.GetAll();
    }
}

Now in your unit test, you create a mock of FooDataProvider, which allows you to call the method GetAllFoos without having to actually hit the database.
class BarTests
{
    public TestGetAllFoos() {
        // here we set up our mock FooDataProvider
        mockRepository = MockingFramework.new()
        mockFooDataProvider = mockRepository.CreateMockOfType(FooDataProvider);

        // create a new array of Foo objects
        testFooArray = new Foo[] {Foo.new(), Foo.new(), Foo.new()}

        // the next statement will cause testFooArray to be returned every time we call FooDAtaProvider.GetAllFoos,
        // instead of calling to the database and returning whatever is in there
        // ExpectCallTo and Returns are methods provided by our imaginary mocking framework
        ExpectCallTo(mockFooDataProvider.GetAllFoos).Returns(testFooArray)

        // now begins our actual unit test
        testBar = new Bar(mockFooDataProvider)
        baz = testBar.GetAllFoos()

        // baz should now equal the testFooArray object we created earlier
        Assert.AreEqual(3, baz.length)

My personal top3: 

violating the strict aliasing rule
violating the strict aliasing rule
violating the strict aliasing rule
:-)

Edit Here is a little example that does it wrong twice:
(assume 32 bit ints and little endian)
float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  unsigned int temp = *(unsigned int *)&a;
  temp &= 0x7fffffff;
  return *(float *)&temp;
}

That code tries to get the absolute value of a float by bit-twiddling with the sign bit directly in the representation of a float.
However, the result of creating a pointer to an object by casting from one type to another is not valid C. The compiler may assume that pointers to different types don't point to the same chunk of memory. This is true for all kind of pointers except void* and char* (sign-ness does not matter). 
In the case above I do that twice. Once to get an int-alias for the float a, and once to convert the value back to float. 
There are three valid ways to do the same.
Use a char or void pointer during the cast. These always alias to anything, so they are safe.
float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  float temp_float = a;
  // valid, because it's a char pointer. These are special.
  unsigned char * temp = (unsigned char *)&temp_float;
  temp[3] &= 0x7f;
  return temp_float;
}

Use memcopy. Memcpy takes void pointers, so it will force aliasing as well. 
float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  int i;
  float result;
  memcpy (&i, &a, sizeof (int));
  i &= 0x7fffffff;
  memcpy (&result, &i, sizeof (int));
  return result;
}

The third valid way: use unions. This is explicitly not undefined since C99:
float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  union 
  {
     unsigned int i;
     float f;
  } cast_helper;

  cast_helper.f = a;
  cast_helper.i &= 0x7fffffff;

CPPUnitLite attempts to make a true C++-style testing framework, not a Java one ported to C++. (I'm paraphrasing from Feather's Working Effectively with Legacy Code book). CPPUnitLite2 seems to be another rewrite, with more features and bug fixes.

There's an obvious balance on when to use Silverlight vs. Flash when you're concerned about reach and install base, but here are some reasons Silverlight is a good direction to move in:

Second mover advantage - Just as Microsoft built a ""better Java"" with .NET, they're able to look at how you'd design a RIA plugin from scratch, today. They have the advantage of knowing how people use the web today, something the inventors of Flash could never have accurately guessed. Flash can add features, but they can't realistically chuck the platform and start over.
Developer familiarity - While Silverlight is a new model, it's not entirely unfamiliar to developers. They'll ""get"" the way Silverlight works a lot more quickly than they'll understand firing up a new development environment with a new scripting language and new event paradigms.
Being rid of the timeline model in Flash - Flash was originally built for keyframe based animations, and while there are ways to abstract this away, it's at the core of how Flash works. Silverlight ditches that for an application-centric model. 
ScottGu - ScottGu is fired up about Silverlight. Nuff said.
Cool new features - While Silverlight still has some catching up to do with Flash on some obvious features (like webcam / mic integration, or 3d / graphics acceleration), there are some slick new technologies built in to Silverlight - Deep Zoom is one example. I'm seeing more ""revolutionary"" technologies on the Silverlight side, while Flash seems to be in maintenance mode at this point.

I prefer the Silverlight platform over the Flex platform for the simple fact that Silverlight is all .NET code.  We have more .NET developers on staff than Flash/Flex developers, and most of our Flash/Flex developers are graphic artists (not real programmers).

1) Calling with an array of the parameter type, in which case the params keyword has no effect and the array is passed directly to the method:
object[] array = new[] { ""1"", ""2"" };

// Foo receives the 'array' argument directly.
Foo( array );

2) Or, calling with an extended list of arguments, in which case the compiler will automatically wrap the list of arguments in a temporary array and pass that to the method:
// Foo receives a temporary array containing the list of arguments.
Foo( ""1"", ""2"" );

// This is equivalent to:
object[] temp = new[] { ""1"", ""2"" );
Foo( temp );


In order to pass in an object array to a method with a ""params object[]"" parameter, you can either:
1) Create a wrapper array manually and pass that directly to the method, as mentioned by lassevk:
Foo( new object[] { array } );  // Equivalent to calling convention 1.

2) Or, cast the argument to object, as mentioned by Adam, in which case the compiler will create the wrapper array for you:
Foo( (object)array );  // Equivalent to calling convention 2.


However, if the goal of the method is to process multiple object arrays, it may be easier to declare it with an explicit ""params object[][]"" parameter. This would allow you to pass multiple arrays as arguments:
void Foo( params object[][] arrays ) {
  foreach( object[] array in arrays ) {
    // process array
  }
}

...
Foo( new[] { ""1"", ""2"" }, new[] { ""3"", ""4"" } );

object[][] arrays = new[] {

Are the hash codes equal? Then call the full (slow) Equals method.

How long do you expect the data to be? How random? If lengths vary greatly (say for files) then just return the length.  If lengths are likely to be similar look at a subset of the bytes that varies.
GetHashCode should be a lot quicker than Equals, but doesn't need to be unique.

Any thoughts?

dp: You are right that I missed a check in Equals, I have updated it.  Using the existing hashcode from the byte array will result in reference equality (or at least that same concept translated to hashcodes).
for example:
byte[] b1 = new byte[] { 1 };
byte[] b2 = new byte[] { 1 };
int h1 = b1.GetHashCode();
int h2 = b2.GetHashCode();

With that code, despite the two byte arrays having the same values within them, they are referring to different parts of memory and will result in (probably) different hash codes. I need the hash codes for two byte arrays with the same contents to be equal.

56537,4309.0,2008-09-11T13:36:18Z,54230,50,"CakePHP's built-in ACL system is really powerful, but poorly documented in terms of actual implementation details. A system that we've used with some success in a number of CakePHP-based projects is as follows.
It's a modification of some group-level access systems that have been documented elsewhere. Our system's aims are to have a simple system where users are authorised on a group-level, but they can have specific additional rights on items that were created by them, or on a per-user basis. We wanted to avoid having to create a specific entry for each user (or, more specifically for each ARO) in the aros_acos table.
We have a Users table, and a Roles table.
Users
user_id, user_name, role_id
Roles
id, role_name
Create the ARO tree for each role (we usually have 4 roles - Unauthorised Guest (id 1), Authorised User (id 2), Site Moderator (id 3) and Administrator (id 4)) :
cake acl create aro / Role.1
cake acl create aro 1 Role.2  ... etc ...
After this, you have to use SQL or phpMyAdmin or similar to add aliases for all of these, as the cake command line tool doesn't do it. We use 'Role-{id}' and 'User-{id}' for all of ours.
We then create a ROOT ACO - 
cake acl create aco / 'ROOT'
and then create ACOs for all the controllers under this ROOT one:
cake acl create aco 'ROOT' 'MyController' ... etc ...
So far so normal. We add an additional field in the aros_acos table called _editown  which we can use as an additional action in the ACL component's actionMap.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `aros_acos` (
`id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
`aro_id` int(11) default NULL,
`aco_id` int(11) default NULL,
`_create` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_read` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_update` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_delete` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_editown` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
KEY `acl` (`aro_id`,`aco_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

We can then setup the Auth component to use the 'crud' method, which validates the requested controller/action against an AclComponent::check(). In the app_controller we have something along the lines of:
private function setupAuth() {
    if(isset($this->Auth)) {
        ....
        $this->Auth->authorize = 'crud';
        $this->Auth->actionMap = array( 'index'     => 'read',
                        'add'       => 'create',
                        'edit'      => 'update'
                        'editMine'  => 'editown',
                        'view'      => 'read'
                        ... etc ...
                        );
        ... etc ...
    }
}

Again, this is fairly standard CakePHP stuff. We then have a checkAccess method in the AppController that adds in the group-level stuff to check whether to check a group ARO or a user ARO for access:
private function checkAccess() {
    if(!$user = $this->Auth->user()) {
        $role_alias = 'Role-1';
        $user_alias = null;
    } else {
        $role_alias = 'Role-' . $user['User']['role_id'];
        $user_alias = 'User-' . $user['User']['id'];
    }

    // do we have an aro for this user?
    if($user_alias && ($user_aro = $this->User->Aro->findByAlias($user_alias))) {
        $aro_alias = $user_alias;
    } else {
        $aro_alias = $role_alias;
    }

    if ('editown' == $this->Auth->actionMap[$this->action]) {
        if($this->Acl->check($aro_alias, $this->name, 'editown') and $this->isMine()) {
            $this->Auth->allow();
        } else {
            $this->Auth->authorize = 'controller';
            $this->Auth->deny('*');
        }
    } else {
        // check this user-level aro for access
        if($this->Acl->check($aro_alias, $this->name, $this->Auth->actionMap[$this->action])) {
            $this->Auth->allow();
        } else {
            $this->Auth->authorize = 'controller';
            $this->Auth->deny('*');
        }
    }
}

The setupAuth() and checkAccess() methods are called in the AppController's beforeFilter() callback. There's an isMine method in the AppControler too (see below) that just checks that the user_id of the requested item is the same as the currently authenticated user. I've left this out for clarity.
That's really all there is to it. You can then allow / deny particular groups access to specific acos - 
cake acl grant 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'read'
cake acl grant 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'editown'
cake acl deny 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'update'
cake acl deny 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'delete'
I'm sure you get the picture.
Anyway, this answer's way longer than I intended it to be, and it probably makes next to no sense, but I hope it's some help to you ...
-- edit --
As requested, here's an edited (purely for clarity - there's a lot of stuff in our boilerplate code that's meaningless here) isMine() method that we have in our AppController. I've removed a lot of error checking stuff too, but this is the essence of it:
function isMine($model=null, $id=null, $usermodel='User', $foreignkey='user_id') {
    if(empty($model)) {
        // default model is first item in $this->uses array
        $model = $this->uses[0];
    }

    if(empty($id)) {
        if(!empty($this->passedArgs['id'])) {

        } elseif(!empty($this->passedArgs[0])) {
            $id = $this->passedArgs[0];
        }
    }

    if(is_array($id)) {
        foreach($id as $i) {
            if(!$this->_isMine($model, $i, $usermodel, $foreignkey)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    return $this->_isMine($model, $id, $usermodel, $foreignkey);
}


function _isMine($model, $id, $usermodel='User', $foreignkey='user_id') {
    $user = Configure::read('curr.loggedinuser'); // this is set in the UsersController on successful login

    if(isset($this->$model)) {
        $model = $this->$model;
    } else {
        $model = ClassRegistry::init($model);
    }

    //read model
    if(!($record = $model->read(null, $id))) {
        return false;

In his examples his user groups are set up as a cascading tree, with the most general user type being at the top of the tree, and its children branching off for each more restricted access type.  Elsewhere I've usually seen each user type as a child of the same generic user type.

They are important because they are considered by the compiler to apply the interface principle. Basically, it can be explained by an example:
namespace ns {

class A
{
};

void print(A a)
{
}

}

If you wanted to print an A object, the code would be this one:
ns::A a;
print(a);

Note that we didn't explicitly mention the namespace when calling the function. This is the interface principle: C++ consider a function taking a type as an argument as being part of the interface for that type, so no need to specify the namespace because the parameter already implied the namespace.
Now why this principle is important? Imagine that the class A author did not provide a print() function for this class. You will have to provide one yourself. As you are a good programmer, you will define this function in your own namespace, or maybe in the global namespace.
namespace ns {

class A
{
};

}

void print(A a)
{
}

And your code can start calling the print(a) function wherever you want. Now imagine that years later, the author decides to provide a print() function, better than yours because he knows the internals of his class and can make a better version than yours.
Then C++ authors decided that his version of the print() function should be used instead of the one provided in another namespace, to respect the interface principle. And that this ""upgrade"" of the print() function should be as easy as possible, which means that you won't have to change every call to the print() function. That's why ""interface functions"" (function in the same namespace as a class) can be called without specifying the namespace in C++.
And that's why you should consider a C++ namespace as an ""interface"" when you use one and keep in mind the interface principle.
If you want better explanation of this behavior, you can refer to the book Exceptional C++ from Herb Sutter

Importance of UPSERT - from sqlservercentral.com: 

For every update in the case mentioned above we are removing one
  additional read from the table if we
  use the UPSERT instead of EXISTS.
  Unfortunately for an Insert, both the
  UPSERT and IF EXISTS methods use the
  same number of reads on the table.
  Therefore the check for existence
  should only be done when there is a
  very valid reason to justify the
  additional I/O. The optimized way to
  do things is to make sure that you
  have little reads as possible on the

The best strategy is to attempt the
  update. If no rows are affected by the
  update then insert. In most
  circumstances, the row will already
  exist and only one I/O will be
  required.

update myTable set Col1=@col1, Col2=@col2 where ID=@ID
if @@rowcount = 0
insert into myTable (Col1, Col2) values (@col1, @col2)

My logic behind writing it in this way is that the update will perform an implicit select using the where clause and if that returns 0 then the insert will take place.
The alternative to doing it this way would be to do a select and then based on the number of rows returned either do an update or insert. This I considered inefficient because if you are to do an update it will cause 2 selects (the first explicit select call and the second implicit in the where of the update). If the proc were to do an insert then there'd be no difference in efficiency.

There's also MbUnit.  It's like NUnit, but has nifty features like RowTest (run the same test with different parameters) and Rollback (put the database back like you found it after a test)

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).

OBP breaks down very quickly IMHO since you are essentially getting the worst of both words: 1) Procedural programming without adhering to proven structured programming methodology and 2) OOP without adhering to to proven OOP methodology.  
OOP done right is a beautiful thing. It makes very difficult problems easy to solve, and to the uninitiated (not trying to sound pompous there), it can almost seem like magic. That being said, OOP is just one tool in the toolbox of programming methodologies. It is not the be all end all methodology. It just happens to suit large business applications well.   
Most developers who work in OOP languages are utilizing examples of OOP done right in the frameworks and types that they use day-to-day, but they just aren't aware of it. Here are some very simple examples: ADO.NET, Hibernate/NHibernate, Logging Frameworks, various language collection types, the ASP.NET stack, The JSP stack etc... These are all things that heavily rely on OOP in their codebases.
",24270,2131.0,2008-08-23T14:40:28Z,,126,What's the point of OOP?,"As far as I can tell, in spite of the countless millions or billions spent on OOP education, languages, and tools, OOP has not improved developer productivity or software reliability, nor has it reduced development costs. Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).
So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?

So, be careful trying to wrap an Enumeration as an Iterable. If someone passes me an Iterable, I will assume that I can call iterator() on it repeatedly, creating as many Iterator instances as I want, and iterating independently on each. A wrapped Enumeration will not fulfill this contract; don't let your wrapped Enumeration escape from your own code. (As an aside, I noticed that Java 7's DirectoryStream violates expectations in just this way, and shouldn't be allowed to ""escape"" either.)
Enumeration is like an Iterator, not an Iterable. A Collection is Iterable. An Iterator is not.
You can't do this:
Vector<X> list = â¦

Don't write ginormous tests. As the 'unit' in 'unit test' suggests, make each one as atomic and isolated as possible. If you must, create preconditions using mock objects, rather than recreating too much of the typical user environment manually.
Don't test things that obviously work. Avoid testing the classes from a third-party vendor, especially the one supplying the core APIs of the framework you code in. E.g., don't test adding an item to the vendor's Hashtable class.
Consider using a code coverage tool such as NCover to help discover edge cases you have yet to test.
Try writing the test before the implementation. Think of the test as more of a specification that your implementation will adhere to. Cf. also behavior-driven development, a more specific branch of test-driven development.
Be consistent. If you only write tests for some of your code, it's hardly useful. If you work in a team, and some or all of the others don't write tests, it's not very useful either. Convince yourself and everyone else of the importance (and time-saving properties) of testing, or don't bother.

Use the CompletionPrefix.  By default, nearly all of the templates have a special prefix that, if you type and then hit the escape key, will result in the template being inserted.  You can use Control-/ to move between the completion fields.
You can see a full list of Xcode's default macros and their associated CompletionPrefixes at Crooked Spin.
You can also add your own macros, or modify the defaults.  To do so, edit the file /Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/{C,HTML}.xctxtmacro.  The syntax should be self-explanatory, if not terribly friendly.

Unfortunately, if you're addicted to R#, you will be disappointed by your refactoring options.  Basic refactoring is provided within Xcode through the context menu or by hitting Shift-Apple-J.  From there, you can extract and rename methods, promote and demote them through the class hierarchy, and a few other common operations.  Unfortunately, neither Xcode nor any third-party utilities offer anything approaching Resharper, so on that front, you're currently out of luck.  Thankfully, Apple has already demonstrated versions of Xcode in the works that have vastly improved refactoring capabilities, so hopefully you won't have to wait too long before the situation starts to improve.

It's also known as the Cheshire Cat because of Lewis Caroll's character that fades away until only the grin remains.
The example code should be distributed across two sets of source files. Then only Cat.h is the file that is shipped with the product.
CatImpl.h is included by Cat.cpp and CatImpl.cpp contains the implementation for CatImpl::Purr(). This won't be visible to the public using your product.
Basically the idea is to hide as much as possible of the implementation fom prying eyes.
This is most useful where you have a commercial product that is shipped as a series of libraries that are accessed via an API that the customer's code is compiled against and linked to.
We did this with the rewrite of IONAs Orbix 3.3 product in 2000.
As mentioned by others, using his technique completely decouples the implementation from the interface of the object. Then you won't have to recompile everything that uses Cat if you just want to change the implementation of Purr().

The PIMPL Idiom (Pointer to IMPLementation) is a technique for implementation hiding in which a public class wraps a structure or class that cannot be seen outside the library the public class is part of.
This hides internal implementation details and data from the user of the library.
When implementing this idiom why would you place the public methods on the pimpl class and not the public class since the public classes method implementations would be compiled into the library and the user only has the header file?
To illustrate, this code puts the Purr() implementation on the impl class and wraps it as well.
Why not implement Purr directly on the public class?
// header file:
class Cat {
    private:
        class CatImpl;  // Not defined here
        CatImpl *cat_;  // Handle

    public:
        Cat();            // Constructor
        ~Cat();           // Destructor
        // Other operations...
        Purr();
};


// CPP file:
#include ""cat.h""

    Purr();

So, as expected, the interpolation are virtually identical (noise level differences, probably due to the extra characters the interpolation engine needs to handle). Straight up concatenation is about 66% of the speed, which is no great shock. The interpolation parser will look, find nothing to do, then finish with a simple internal string concat. Even if the concat were expensive, the interpolator will still have to do it, after all the work to parse out the variable and trim/copy up the original string.

Cryptography is not the solution to your security problems. It might be part of the solution, or it might be part of the problem. In many situations, cryptography starts out by making the problem worse, and it isn't at all clear that using cryptography is an improvement.

Essentially encrypting your emails in the database 'just in case' is not really making the database more secure. Where are the keys stored for the database? What file permissions are used for these keys? Is the database accesable publically? Why? What kind of account restrictions are in place for these accounts? Where is the machine stored, who has physical access to this box? What about remote login/ssh access etc. etc. etc.
So I guess you can encrypt the emails if you want, but if that is the extent of the security of the system then it really isn't doing much, and would actually make the job of maintaining the database harder.
Of course this could be part of an extensive security policy for your system - if so then great!
I'm not saying that it is a bad idea - But why have a lock on the door from Deadlocks'R'us which cost $5000 when they can cut through the plywood around the door? Or come in through the window which you left open? Or even worse they find the key which was left under the doormat. Security of a system is only as good as the weakest link. If they have root access then they can pretty much do what they want.
Steve Morgan makes a good point that even if they cannot understand the email addresses, they can still do a lot of harm (which could be mitigated if they only had SELECT access)
Its also important to know what your reasons are for storing the email address at all. I might have gone a bit overboard with this answer, but my point is do you really need to store an email address for an account? The most secure data is data that doesn't exist.

In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).
To take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.
Some help can come from tools like JDepend which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like Structure 101.
Purely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from ""normal"" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.
OSGi is a deep and wide component model, documentation I recommend:

OSGi R4 Specification: Get the PDFs of the Core and Compendium specification, they are canonical, authoritative and very readable. Have a shortcut to them handy at all times, you will consult them.
Read up on OSGi best practices, there is a large set of things you can do but a somewhat smaller set of things you should do and there are some things you should never do (DynamicImport: * for example).

The zero-initialization (dcl.init) of all local objects with 
  static storage  duration  (basic.stc.static) is performed before
  any other initialization  takes   place. A   local  object of 
  POD type (basic.types)  with static  storage  duration
  initialized with constant-expressions is initialized before its
  block is first entered. An implementation  is  permitted to perform
  early initialization of other local objects with static storage
  duration under the same conditions that an implementation is
  permitted to statically initialize an object with static storage
  duration in namespace scope  (basic.start.init). Otherwise  such
  an object is initialized the first time control passes through its
  declaration; such an object is considered initialized upon the
  completion of its initialization. If the initialization exits by 
  throwing an exception, the initialization is not complete, so it will
  be  tried again the next time control enters the declaration.  If control re-enters the declaration (recursively) while the object is being
  initialized, the behavior is undefined.  [Example:

Bigger C++ projects I've seen hardly used more than one namespace (e.g. boost library).

Actually boost uses tons of namespaces, typically every part of boost has its own namespace for the inner workings and then may put only the public interface in the top-level namespace boost.
Personally I think that the larger a code-base becomes, the more important namespaces become, even within a single application (or library). At work we put each module of our application in its own namespace.
Another use (no pun intended) of namespaces that I use a lot is the anonymous namespace:

My current solution, which sucks, is to send the datetimes into a UDF to convert them to midnight of the same day, and then check those dates for equality.  When it comes to the query plan, this is a disaster, as are almost all UDFs in joins or where clauses.  This is one of the only places in my application that I haven't been able to root out the functions and give the query optimizer something it can actually use to locate the best index.
In this case, merging the function code back into the query seems impractical.
I think I am missing something simple here.
Here's the function for reference.
if not exists (select * from dbo.sysobjects 
              where id = object_id(N'dbo.f_MakeDate') and

    @Day datetime, 
    @Hour int, 
    @Minute int
)
returns datetime
as

/*

Creates a datetime using the year-month-day portion of @Day, and the 
@Hour and @Minute provided

*/

begin

declare @retval datetime
set @retval = cast(
    cast(datepart(m, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(d, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(yyyy, @Day) as varchar(4)) + 
    ' ' + 
    cast(@Hour as varchar(2)) + 
    ':' + 
    cast(@Minute as varchar(2)) as datetime)
return @retval
end

go

To complicate matters, I am joining on time zone tables to check the date against the local time, which could be different for every row:
where 
dbo.f_MakeDate(dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), 0, 0) = @activityDateMidnight

[Edit]
I'm incorporating @Todd's suggestion:
where datediff(day, dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), @ActivityDate) = 0

My misconception about how datediff works (the same day of year in consecutive years yields 366, not 0 as I expected) caused me to waste a lot of effort.
But the query plan didn't change.  I think I need to go back to the drawing board with the whole thing.

The PIMPL Idiom (Pointer to IMPLementation) is a technique for implementation hiding in which a public class wraps a structure or class that cannot be seen outside the library the public class is part of.
This hides internal implementation details and data from the user of the library.
When implementing this idiom why would you place the public methods on the pimpl class and not the public class since the public classes method implementations would be compiled into the library and the user only has the header file?
To illustrate, this code puts the Purr() implementation on the impl class and wraps it as well.
Why not implement Purr directly on the public class?

Another option is to use Matlab's profiler. The command is profile, it can also be used to track dependencies.  To use profile, you could do 
>> profile on   % turn profiling on
>> foo;         % entry point to your matlab function or script
>> profile off  % turn profiling off
>> profview     % view the report

If profiler is not available, then perhaps the following two functions are (for pre-MATLAB 2015a):

depdir

>> deps = depfun('foo');

gives a structure, deps, that contains all the dependencies of foo.m.

As you can see, it is somewhat desirable to not need to do this manually.
So far I've only tried AutoJar and ProGuard, both of which were fairly easy to get running. It appears that there's some issue with the constant pool in the JAR files.
Apparently jrst is slightly broken, so I'll make a go of fixing it. The Maven pom.xml file was apparently broken too, so I'll have to fix that before fixing jrst ... I feel like a bug-magnet :-)

Update: I never got around to fixing this application, but I checked out Eclipse's ""Runnable JAR export wizard"" which is based on a fat JAR. I found this very easy to use for deploying my own code.
Some of the other excellent suggestions might be better for builds in a non-Eclipse environment, oss probably should make a nice build using Ant. (Maven, so far has just given me pain, but others love it.)

This allows only one thread to access the interpreter.  This means two things:  1)  you rarely ever find yourself using a lock statement in python and 2) if you want to take advantage of multi-processor systems, you have to use separate processes.  EDIT:  I should also point out that you can put some of the code in C/C++ if you want to get around the GIL as well.
Thus, you need to re-consider why you want to use threads.  If you want to parallelize your app to take advantage of dual-core architecture, you need to consider breaking your app up into multiple processes.
If you want to improve responsiveness, you should CONSIDER using threads.  There are other alternatives though, namely microthreading.  There are also some frameworks that you should look into:

You'll notice that there are a few bits in there that you might not need.
For example, my app needed to retain the successfully-logged-in LDAP context for further use by the user once logged in -- the app's purpose is to let users log in via their AD credentials and then perform further AD-related functions.  So because of that, I have a custom authentication token, LdapAuthenticationToken, that I pass around (rather than Spring's default Authentication token) which allows me to attach the LDAP context.  In LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate(), I create that token and pass it back out; in LdapAuthenticatorImpl.authenticate(), I attach the logged-in context to the return object so that it can be added to the user's Spring authentication object.
Also, in LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate(), I assign all logged-in users the ROLE_USER role -- that's what lets me then test for that role in my intercept-url elements.  You'll want to make this match whatever role you want to test for, or even assign roles based on Active Directory groups or whatever.
Finally, and a corollary to that, the way I implemented LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate() gives all users with valid AD accounts the same ROLE_USER role.  Obviously, in that method, you can perform further tests on the user (i.e., is the user in a specific AD group?) and assign roles that way, or even test for some condition before even granting the user access at all.

Reuse is a side-effect of an good design and proper level of abstraction.  Code achieves reuse by doing something useful, but not doing so much as to make it inflexible.  It does not matter whether the code is OO or not - we reuse what works and is not trivial to do ourselves.  That's pragmatism.
The thought of OO as a new way to get to reuse through inheritance is fundamentally flawed.  As you note the LSP violations abound.  Instead, OO is properly thought of as a method of managing the complexity of a problem domain.  The goal is maintainability of a system over time.  The primary tool for achieving this is the separation of public interface from a private implementation.  This allows us to have rules like ""This should only be modified using ..."" enforced by the compiler, rather than code review.
Using this, I'm sure you will agree, allows us to create and maintain hugely complex systems.  There is lots of value in that, and it is not easy to do in other paradigms.
",24270,2131.0,2008-08-23T14:40:28Z,,126,What's the point of OOP?,"As far as I can tell, in spite of the countless millions or billions spent on OOP education, languages, and tools, OOP has not improved developer productivity or software reliability, nor has it reduced development costs. Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).

From T-SQL there is no way to access multiple results of a nested stored procedure call, without changing the stored procedure as others have suggested.
To be complete, if the procedure were returning a single result, you could insert it into a temp table or table variable with the following syntax:
INSERT INTO #Table (...columns...)
EXEC MySproc ...parameters...

You can use the same syntax for a procedure that returns multiple results, but it will only process the first result, the rest will be discarded.

95888,18103.0,2008-09-18T19:14:56Z,95820,31,"@hash{@keys} = undef;

The syntax here where you are referring to the hash with an @ is a hash slice.  We're basically saying $hash{$keys[0]} AND $hash{$keys[1]} AND $hash{$keys[2]} ... is a list on the left hand side of the =, an lvalue, and we're assigning to that list, which actually goes into the hash and sets the values for all the named keys.  In this case, I only specified one value, so that value goes into $hash{$keys[0]}, and the other hash entries all auto-vivify (come to life) with undefined values.  [My original suggestion here was set the expression = 1, which would've set that one key to 1 and the others to undef.  I changed it for consistency, but as we'll see below, the exact values do not matter.]
When you realize that the lvalue, the expression on the left hand side of the =, is a list built out of the hash, then it'll start to make some sense why we're using that @.  [Except I think this will change in Perl 6.]
The idea here is that you are using the hash as a set.  What matters is not the value I am assigning; it's just the existence of the keys.  So what you want to do is not something like:
if ($hash{$key} == 1) # then key is in the hash

instead:
if (exists $hash{$key}) # then key is in the set

It's actually more efficient to just run an exists check than to bother with the value in the hash, although to me the important thing here is just the concept that you are representing a set just with the keys of the hash.  Also, somebody pointed out that by using undef as the value here, we will consume less storage space than we would assigning a value.  (And also generate less confusion, as the value does not matter, and my solution would assign a value only to the first element in the hash and leave the others undef, and some other solutions are turning cartwheels to build an array of values to go into the hash; completely wasted effort).

In Rails, you essentially start by defining your tables (with field names and their specifics). Then ActiveRecord will map them to Ruby classes or models.
In Grails, it's the reverse: you start by defining your models (Groovy classes) and when you hit run, GORM (Grails ActiveRecord equivalent) will create the related database and tables (or update them). Which may also be why you don't have the concept of 'migrations' in Grails (although I think it will come in some future release).

If you are primarily inserting 1000 rows a second and not doing any querying, then a clustered index is a hit to performance.  If you are doing 1000 queries a second, then not having an index will lead to very bad performance.  The best thing to do when trying to tune queries/indexes is to use the Query Plan Analyzer and SQL Profiler in SQL Server.  This will show you where you are running into costly table scans or other performance blockers.
As for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both.  I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.  Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html.
As with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer.  It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals.
[Edit]
@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key:

For example, there is an issue known as a ""hotspot"", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table's data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts.
Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times.
If you even think you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there.
Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by this server, but all values generated by all computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record's permanent key value at the time the record is created.

",5600,615.0,2008-08-08T02:47:15Z,,37,Tables with no Primary Key,"I have several tables whose only unique data is a uniqueidentifier (a Guid) column. Because guids are non-sequential (and they're client-side generated so I can't use newsequentialid()), I have made a non-primary, non-clustered index on this ID field rather than giving the tables a clustered primary key.
I'm wondering what the performance implications are for this approach. I've seen some people suggest that tables should have an auto-incrementing (""identity"") int as a clustered primary key even if it doesn't have any meaning, as it means that the database engine itself can use that value to quickly look up a row instead of having to use a bookmark.
My database is merge-replicated across a bunch of servers, so I've shied away from identity int columns as they're a bit hairy to get right in replication.
What are your thoughts? Should tables have primary keys? Or is it ok to not have any clustered indexes if there are no sensible columns to index that way?

Identify the OpenGL extension and the extension APIs you wish to use. OpenGL extensions are listed in the OpenGL Extension Registry.
Check if your graphic card supports the extensions you wish to use. Download and install the latest drivers and SDKs for your graphics card.
Recent versions of NVIDIA OpenGL SDK ship with GLEW. If you're using this, then you don't need to do some of the following steps.
Download GLEW and unzip it.
Add the GLEW bin path to your Windows PATH environment variable. Alternatively, you can also place the glew32.dll in a directory where Windows picks up its DLLs.
Add the GLEW include path to your compiler's include directory list.
Add the GLEW lib path to your compiler's library directory list.
Instruct your compiler to use glew32.lib during linking. If you're using Visual C++ compilers then one way to do this is by adding the following line to your code:
#pragma comment(lib, ""glew32.lib"")

Add a #include <GL/glew.h> line to your code. Ensure that this is placed above the includes of other GL header files. (You may actually not need the GL header files includes if you include glew.h.)
Initialize GLEW using glewInit() after you've initialized GLUT or GL. If it fails, then something is wrong with your setup.
if (GLEW_OK != glewInit())
{
    // GLEW failed!
    exit(1);
}

Check if the extension(s) you wish to use are now available through GLEW. You do this by checking a boolean variable named GLEW_your_extension_name which is exposed by GLEW.

Example:

if (!GLEW_EXT_framebuffer_object)
{
    exit(1);
}

That's it! You can now use the OpenGL extension calls in your code just as if they existed naturally for Windows.

Everything goes: one-liners in your favorite scripting language, command-line tools or other utilities for OS, web sites, etc.
Best solutions so far:
On Linux/UNIX/OS X/cygwin:

Gnu iconv suggested by Troels Arvin is best used as a filter. It seems to be universally available. Example:
$ iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-15 in.txt > out.txt

As pointed out by Ben, there is an online converter using iconv.
Gnu recode (manual) suggested by Cheekysoft will convert one or several files in-place. Example:
$ recode UTF8..ISO-8859-15 in.txt

This one uses shorter aliases:
$ recode utf8..l9 in.txt

Recode also supports surfaces which can be used to convert between different line ending types and encodings:
Convert newlines from LF (Unix) to CR-LF (DOS):
$ recode ../CR-LF in.txt

Base64 encode file:
$ recode ../Base64 in.txt

You can also combine them.
Convert a Base64 encoded UTF8 file with Unix line endings to Base64 encoded Latin 1 file with Dos line endings:
$ recode utf8/Base64..l1/CR-LF/Base64 file.txt


On Windows with Powershell (Jay Bazuzi): 

PS C:\> gc -en utf8 in.txt | Out-File -en ascii out.txt
(No ISO-8859-15 support though; it says that supported charsets are unicode, utf7, utf8, utf32, ascii, bigendianunicode, default, and oem.)

Edit
Do you mean iso-8859-1 support? Using ""String"" does this e.g. for vice versa
gc -en string in.txt | Out-File -en utf8 out.txt

Note: The possible enumeration values are ""Unknown, String, Unicode, Byte, BigEndianUnicode, UTF8, UTF7, Ascii"".

At the very least, make sure old cookies lose their value after a while. Even a successful hijaking attack will be thwarted when the cookie stops working.

Make sure that whenever a user clicks on your site's ""log out"" link, that the old session UUID can never be used again. 
I'm not sure if this idea will work but here goes: Add a serial number into your session cookie, maybe a string like this:
SessionUUID, Serial Num, Current Date/Time
Encrypt this string and use it as your session cookie. Regularly change the serial num - maybe when the cookie is 5 minutes old and then reissue the cookie.  You could even reissue it on every page view if you wanted to. On the server side, keep a record of the last serial num you've issued for that session.  If someone ever sends a cookie with the wrong serial number it means that an attacker may be using a cookie they intercepted earlier so invalidate the session UUID and ask the user to reenter their password and then reissue a new cookie.
Remember that your user may have more than one computer so they may have more than one active session. Don't do something that forces them to log in again every time they switch between computers.

That doesn't mean it's solved the fundamental problem of software messiness, and it doesn't mean the average developer is an OOP expert. But the modularization of function into object-components has certainly reduced the amount of spaghetti code out there in the world.
I can think of dozens of libraries off the top of my head which are beautifully reusable and which have saved time and money that can never be calculated.
But to the extent that OOP has been a waste of time, I'd say it's because of lack of programmer training, compounded by the steep learning curve of learning a language specific OOP mapping. Some people ""get"" OOP and others never will.

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).

Another option is to use a library which has some nice facilities for comparing objects - I use and recommend MochiKit.

One-JAR uses a custom class-loader which can navigate nested resources. Look at the .bat file in the download, it looks like org.codelutin.jrst.JRST in the jrst-0.8.1.jar is the main class, so your manifest should look like this:
Main-Class: com.simontuffs.onejar.Boot
One-Jar-Main-Class: org.codelutin.jrst.JRST

The really cool thing is that One-JAR will handle passing on command-line arguments for you. The classpath is handled by the custom class loader, assuming all the resources you need are bundled into the single JAR.
The easiest way to use One-JAR is with ant; there's a custom ""one-jar"" ant task which works as follows (assuming your manifest is called ""rst.mf""):

As you can see, it is somewhat desirable to not need to do this manually.
So far I've only tried AutoJar and ProGuard, both of which were fairly easy to get running. It appears that there's some issue with the constant pool in the JAR files.
Apparently jrst is slightly broken, so I'll make a go of fixing it. The Maven pom.xml file was apparently broken too, so I'll have to fix that before fixing jrst ... I feel like a bug-magnet :-)

Update: I never got around to fixing this application, but I checked out Eclipse's ""Runnable JAR export wizard"" which is based on a fat JAR. I found this very easy to use for deploying my own code.
Some of the other excellent suggestions might be better for builds in a non-Eclipse environment, oss probably should make a nice build using Ant. (Maven, so far has just given me pain, but others love it.)

C specifies the following specifiers for variables: auto, extern, register, static.
Storage
The storage duration determines how long your variable will live in ram.
There are three types of storage duration: static, automatic and dynamic.
static
If your variable is declared at file scope, or with an extern or static specifier, it will have static storage. The variable will exist for as long as the program is executing. No execution time is spent to create these variables.
automatic
If the variable is declared in a function, but without the extern or static specifier, it has automatic storage. The variable will exist only while you are executing the function.  Once you return, the variable no longer exist.  Automatic storage is typically done on the stack.  It is a very fast operation to create these variables (simply increment the stack pointer by the size).
dynamic
If you use malloc (or new in C++) you are using dynamic storage.  This storage will exist until you call free (or delete). This is the most expensive way to create storage, as the system must manage allocation and deallocation dynamically.
Linkage
Linkage specifies who can see and reference the variable. There are three types of linkage: internal linkage, external linkage and no linkage.
no linkage
This variable is only visible where it was declared. Typically applies to variables declared in a function.
internal linkage
This variable will be visible to all the functions within the file (called a translation unit), but other files will not know it exists.
external linkage
The variable will be visible to other translation units.  These are often thought of as ""global variables"".
Here is a table describing the storage and linkage characteristics based on the specifiers

  Storage Class   Function            File

We're about to ramp up a new project where nearly all of our database op's will be fairly simple data retrievals (there's another segment of the project which already writes the data). Most of our other projects up to this point make use of stored procedures for such things. However, I'd like to leverage LINQ-to-SQL if it makes more sense.

âCopy leftâ is the philosophy of the free software foundation requiring anything incorporating the licensed opens source code to also be licensed as open source.  That philosophy is regarded as poison by established companies that want to keep their products proprietary.
Aside from not having âcopy leftâ provisions, the Apache license specifically addresses the grant of rights from project contributors and it expressly addresses the fact that modern companies are typically made up for more than one legal entity (for example, a parent company and its subsidiaries).  Most open source licenses donât address these points.
Whatever license you choose, if you want your code to be âcorporate friendly,â in the sense that you want it to be incorporated into commercial, non-open source products, it is essential that you avoid GPL and other âcopy leftâ type licenses.  While it would be best to consult with your own lawyer before investing time or money in a project for which this is an important factor, a quick shorthand for licenses that are and are not âcopy leftâ can be found on the Free Software Foundationâs website.  They identify which licenses they donât find meet their standards as âcopy left.â  The ones FSF rejects are most likely the ones that will be corporate friendly in this sense.
(Although the question didnât ask this, it is worth mentioning that, with very few exceptions, even GPL and other âcopy leftâ type licenses are perfectly corporate friendly if they are only used internally by the commercial entities and not incorporated into their products.)

Your pure functional programming nightmares come true!
The only Esoteric Turing-complete Programming Language that has:

A purely functional foundation, core, and libraries---in fact, here's the complete API: S K I
No lambdas even!
No numbers or lists needed or allowed
No explicit recursion but yet, allows recursion
A simple infinite lazy stream-based I/O mechanism

Here's the Factorial code in all its parenthetical glory:
K(SII(S(K(S(S(KS)(S(K(S(KS)))(S(K(S(KK)))(S(K(S(K(S(K(S(K(S(SI(K(S(K(S(S(KS)K)I))
 (S(S(KS)K)(SII(S(S(KS)K)I))))))))K))))))(S(K(S(K(S(SI(K(S(K(S(SI(K(S(K(S(S(KS)K)I))
 (S(S(KS)K)(SII(S(S(KS)K)I))(S(S(KS)K))(S(SII)I(S(S(KS)K)I))))))))K)))))))
 (S(S(KS)K)(K(S(S(KS)K)))))))))(K(S(K(S(S(KS)K)))K))))(SII))II)

Features:

No subtraction or conditionals
Prints all factorials (if you wait long enough)
Uses a second layer of Church numerals to convert the Nth factorial to N! asterisks followed by a newline
Uses the Y combinator for recursion

In case you are interested in trying to understand it, here is the Scheme source code to run through the Lazier compiler:
(lazy-def '(fac input)
   '((Y (lambda (f n a) ((lambda (b) ((cons 10) ((b (cons 42)) (f (1+ n) b))))
       (* a n)))) 1 1))

(for suitable definitions of Y, cons, 1, 10, 42, 1+, and *).
EDIT:

We are implementing a process of 
1) Business Requirements Statement (BRS)
2) Functional Specification
3) Technical specification
The BRS covers what the business problems are, and what the requirements are around solutions, testing, security, reliability and delivery. This defines what would make a successful solution.
The functional spec details what is needed, how it should look, how long fields should be, etc.
The technical spec details where the data comes from, any tricky code that may need to be considered.
The customer owns the requirements. The developers own the tech specs, and the functional spec is a middle ground. Testing is done against the tech specs (usually unit testing) then against the functional specs (usually system testing) and then against the requirements (UAT).
The important part of this (and we are struggling with) is that the developers still need to deliver to the functional spec, and the original business requirements. In reality the functional and tech specs are just there for clarity.

A table's primary key should be used for identifying uniquely the row, mainly for join purposes. Think a Persons table: names can change, and they're not guaranteed unique.
Think Companies: you're a happy Merkin company doing business with other companies in Merkia. You are clever enough not to use the company name as the primary key, so you use Merkia's government's unique company ID in its entirety of 10 alphanumeric characters. 
Then Merkia changes the company IDs because they thought it would be a good idea. It's ok, you use your db engine's cascaded updates feature, for a change that shouldn't involve you in the first place. Later on, your business expands, and now you work with a company in Freedonia. Freedonian company id are up to 16 characters. You need to enlarge the company id primary key (also the foreign key fields in Orders, Issues, MoneyTransfers etc), adding a Country field in the primary key (also in the foreign keys). Ouch! Civil war in Freedonia, it's split in three countries. The country name of your associate should be changed to the new one; cascaded updates to the rescue. BTW, what's your primary key? (Country, CompanyID) or (CompanyID, Country)? The latter helps joins, the former avoids another index (or perhaps many, should you want your Orders grouped by country too).
All these are not proof, but an indication that a surrogate key to uniquely identify a row for all uses, including join operations, is preferable to a business key.

69252,10703.0,2008-09-16T03:51:20Z,69250,25,"Without any optimization on, the flow through your code is linear.  If you are on line 5 and single step, you step to line 6.  With optimization on, you can get instruction re-ordering, loop unrolling and all sorts of optimizations.
For example:

void foo() {
1:  int i;
2:  for(i = 0; i < 2; )
3:    i++;
4:  return;

In this example, without optimization, you could single step through the code and hit lines 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4
With optimization on, you might get an execution path that looks like: 2, 3, 3, 4 or even just 4! (The function does nothing after all...)
Bottom line, debugging code with optimization enabled can be a royal pain! Especially if you have large functions.
Note that turning on optimization changes the code! In certain environment (safety critical systems), this is unacceptable and the code being debugged has to be the code shipped. Gotta debug with optimization on in that case.
While the optimized and non-optimized code should be ""functionally"" equivalent, under certain circumstances, the behavior will change.
Here is a simplistic example:

    int* ptr = 0xdeadbeef;  // some address to memory-mapped I/O device
    *ptr = 0;   // setup hardware device
    while(*ptr == 1) {    // loop until hardware device is done
       // do something
    }

With optimization off, this is straightforward, and you kinda know what to expect.
However, if you turn optimization on, a couple of things might happen:

The compiler might optimize the while block away (we init to 0, it'll never be 1)
Instead of accessing memory, pointer access might be moved to a register->No I/O Update
memory access might be cached (not necessarily compiler optimization related)

In all these cases, the behavior would be drastically different and most likely wrong.

I believe that CAPTCHA is dying. If someone really wants to break it, it will be broken. I read (somewhere, don't remember where) about a site that gave you free porn in exchange for answering CAPTCHAs to they can be rendered obsolete by bots. So, why bother?

Anyone who really wants to break this padlock can use a pair of bolt cutters, so why bother with the lock?

Anyone who really wants to open this safe can cut it open with an oxyacetylene torch, so why bother putting things in the safe?
Because using the padlock, locking your car, putting valuables in a safe, and using a CAPTCHA weeds out a large spectrum of relatively unsophisticated or unmotivated attackers.

Using a CAPTCHA isn't going to stop all spammers, but it's going to tremendously reduce the amount that requires filtering or manual intervention.

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).

I'll save you all the stuff I've been through - what's by far been the most successful for me is just creating an Order object with ""NotCheckedOut"" status and then adding items to it and the user adds items. This lets users have more than one cart and allows you to mine the tar out of the Orders table. It also is quite easy to transact the order - just change the status.
Persisting ""as they go"" also allows the user to come back and finish the cart off if they can't, for some reason. Forgiveness is massive with eCommerce.

I'm interested in finding some really nice 'wow factor' snippets of F# code which demonstate the elegence of the language, especially compared to C#. For example I really like:-

#light
let ListProduct l = List.fold_left (*) 1 l

Which inputs a list of ints and multiplies each element in the list, i.e. obtains the product of the list (e.g. a list of 1,2,3 would be calculated as 1*2*3=6). The closest C# equivilent, using LINQ and functional concepts is as follows:-
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

...

public static class ListHelper {
  public static int ListProduct(List<int> l) {
    return l.Aggregate(1, (i, j) => i * j);
  }
}    

Before LINQ that would have been:-
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

...

public static class ListHelper {
  public static int ListProduct(List<int> l) {
    int ret = 1;
    foreach (int i in l) ret *= i;
    return ret;

Widget: WidgetID (PK), Title, Price  
User: UserID (PK), FirstName, LastName

Assume that each User-Widget combination is unique. I can see two options for how to structure the connecting table that defines the data relationship:

UserWidgets1: UserWidgetID (PK), WidgetID (FK), UserID (FK)  
UserWidgets2: WidgetID (PK, FK), UserID (PK, FK)

Option 1 has a single column for the Primary Key. However, this seems unnecessary since the only data being stored in the table is the relationship between the two primary tables, and this relationship itself can form a unique key. Thus leading to option 2, which has a two-column primary key, but loses the one-column unique identifier that option 1 has. I could also optionally add a two-column unique index (WidgetID, UserID) to the first table.
Is there any real difference between the two performance-wise, or any reason to prefer one approach over the other for structuring the UserWidgets many-to-many table?

I would recommend to read up on cryptography in general and then do some threat modeling. Some questions (by no means a comprehensive list) you should ask yourself:

Is the module doing the encryption the one which needs to decrypt it (in this case use symmetric crypto) or will it send data to an other module (on an other machine) which will use it (in which case you should consider public-key crypto)
What do you want to protect against? Someone accessing the database but not having the sourcecode (in which case you can hardcode the encryption key directly into the source)? Someone sniffing your local network (you should consider transparent solutions like IPSec)? Someone stealing your server (it can happen even in data centers - in which case full disk encryption should be considered)?
Do you really need to keep the data? Can't you directly pass it to the credit card processor and erase it after you get the confirmation? Can't you store it locally at the client in a cookie or Flash LSO? If you store it at the client, make sure that you encrypt it at the server side before putting it in a cookie. Also, if you are using cookies, make sure that you make them http only.
Is it enough to compare the equality of the data (ie the data that the client has given me is the same data that I have)? If so, consider storing a hash of it. Because credit card numbers are relatively short and use a reduced set of symbols, a unique salt should be generated for each before hashing.

Later edit: note that standard encryption algorithms from the same category (for example 3DES and AES - both being symmetric block cyphers) are of comparable strength. Most (commercial) systems are not broken because somebody bruteforced their encryption, but because their threat modelling was not detailed enough (or flat out they didn't have any). For example you can encrypt all the data, but if you happen to have a public facing web interface which is vulnerable to SQL injection, it won't help you much.

 (expr1, expr2) is like { expr1; expr2; } but you can use the result of expr2 in a function call or assignment.
It is often seen in for loops to initialise or maintain multiple variables like this:
for (low = 0, high = MAXSIZE; low < high; low = newlow, high = newhigh)
{
    /* do something with low and high and put new values
       in newlow and newhigh */
}

Apart from this, I've only used it ""in anger"" in one other case, when wrapping up two operations that should always go together in a macro.  We had code that copied various binary values into a byte buffer for sending on a network, and a pointer maintained where we had got up to:
unsigned char outbuff[BUFFSIZE];
unsigned char *ptr = outbuff;

*ptr++ = first_byte_value;
*ptr++ = second_byte_value;

send_buff(outbuff, (int)(ptr - outbuff));

Where the values were shorts or ints we did this:
*((short *)ptr)++ = short_value;
*((int *)ptr)++ = int_value;

Later we read that this was not really valid C, because (short *)ptr is no longer an l-value and can't be incremented, although our compiler at the time didn't mind.  To fix this, we split the expression in two:
*(short *)ptr = short_value;
ptr += sizeof(short);

However, this approach relied on all developers remembering to put both statements in all the time.  We wanted a function where you could pass in the output pointer, the value and and the value's type.  This being C, not C++ with templates, we couldn't have a function take an arbitrary type, so we settled on a macro:
#define ASSIGN_INCR(p, val, type)  ((*((type) *)(p) = (val)), (p) += sizeof(type))

By using the comma operator we were able to use this in expressions or as statements as we wished:
if (need_to_output_short)
    ASSIGN_INCR(ptr, short_value, short);

latest_pos = ASSIGN_INCR(ptr, int_value, int);

send_buff(outbuff, (int)(ASSIGN_INCR(ptr, last_value, int) - outbuff));

I'm not suggesting any of these examples are good style!  Indeed, I seem to remember Steve McConnell's Code Complete advising against even using comma operators in a for loop: for readability and maintainability, the loop should be controlled by only one variable, and the expressions in the for line itself should only contain loop-control code, not other extra bits of initialisation or loop maintenance.

Skill sets will be easier to find as far as finding C# or VB developers vs finding ActionScript guru's.  However there is the trade off:
Design experience is an investment not only in Designers with artistic skill, but also in the knowledge and tools provided by Adobe.  You can nearly guarantee that a professional designer uses a mac and has experience with Adobe tools.
Right now the Silverlight designer tools are half baked and can be a headache.  For instance Blend errors when trying to render any xaml containing an IValueConverter, this is problematic.  I have no idea what the Adobe developer experience is, I'm sure it is as hairy.
So at this stage of the game it comes down to human resources:  
If you have .NET experience and little invested in Design skills go Silverlight. Programming skills/tools will be transferable.
If you have Design experience and skill set go with Flex.  Designer skills/tools will be transferable.
Either way both client platforms require communication with services to get data, so you will always leverage your existing programing expertise on the back end.

I think you should look at Flex as a long-term play, just as Adobe seems to be doing. There's an obvious balance on when to use Silverlight vs. Flex when you're concerned about reach and install base, but here are more reasons Flex is a good direction to move in:

Second mover advantage - Just as
Adobe built a ""better Java Applet""
with Flash, they're able to look at
how you'd design a runtime from
scratch, today. They have the
advantage of knowing how people use
the web today, something the
inventors of existing client
platforms could never have
accurately guessed. .NET can add
features, but they can't
realistically chuck the platform and
start over.
Designer familiarity - While
Flex/AIR is a new programing model,
it's not entirely unfamiliar to
designers. They'll ""get"" the way
Flex works a lot more quickly than
they'll understand firing up a new
design environment with new feature
poor tools and new animation
paradigms.
Being rid of the RGB color model in
Silverlight- .NET was originally
built for windows and it is at the
core of how it works. Flex ditched a
long time ago for an design-centric
model.
All your tools run on your mac. Nuff
said.

has some catching up to do with
Flash on some obvious features (like

If your objects are tightly coupled to your data layer, it is difficult to do proper unit testing. the first part of unit test, is ""unit"". All units should be able to be tested in isolation.
In my c# projects, I use NHibernate with a completely seperate Data layer. My objects live in the core domain model and are accessed from my application layer. The application layer talks to both the data layer and the domain model layer.
The application layer is also sometimes called the ""Business Layer"".
If you are using PHP, create a specific set of classes for ONLY data access. Make sure your objects have no idea how they are persisted and wire up the two in your application classes.

59184,1194.0,2008-09-12T14:54:28Z,59130,22,"A couple of things that I've learned:

Absolutely and brutally minimize the number of images you have that contain text. Doing so will make your life a billion percent easier since you won't have to get a new set of images for every friggin' language.
Be very wary of css positioning that relies on things always remaining the same size. If  those things contain text, they will not remain the same size, and you will then need to go back and fix your designs.
If you use character types in your sql tables, make sure that any of those that might receive international input are unicode (nchar, nvarchar, ntext). For that matter, I would just standardize on using the unicode versions.
If you're building SQL queries dynamically, make sure that you include the N prefix before any quoted text if there's any chance that text might be unicode. If you end up putting garbage in a SQL table, check to see if that's there.
Make sure that all your web pages definitively state that they are in a unicode format. See Joel's article, mentioned above.
You're going to be using resource files a lot for this project. That's good - ASP.NET 2.0 has great support for such. You'll want to look into the App_LocalResources and App_GlobalResources folder as well as GetLocalResourceObject, GetGlobalResourceObject, and the concept of meta:resourceKey. Chapter 30 of Professional ASP.NET 2.0 has some great content regarding that. The 3.5 version of the book may well have good content there as well, but I don't own it.
Think about fonts. Many of the standard fonts you might want to use aren't unicode capable. I've always had luck with Arial Unicode MS, MS Gothic, MS Mincho. I'm not sure about how cross-platform these are, though. Also, note that not all fonts support all of the Unicode character definition. Again, test, test, test.
Start thinking now about how you're going to get translations into this system. Go talk to whoever is your translation vendor about how they want data passed back and forth for translation. Think about the fact that, through your local resource files, you will likely be repeating some commonly used strings through the system. Do you normalize those into global resource files, or do you have some sort of database layer where only one copy of each text used is generated. In our recent project, we used resource files which were generated from a database table that contained all the translations and the original, english version of the resource files. 
Test. Generally speaking I will test in German, Polish, and an Asian language (Japanese, Chinese, Korean). German and Polish are wordy and nearly guaranteed to stretch text areas, Asian languages use an entirely different set of characters which tests your unicode support.

The main drawback to inline functions is that it can increase the size of your executable (depending on the number of instantiations).  This can be a problem on some platforms (eg. embedded systems), especially if the function itself is recursive.
I'd also recommend making inline'd functions very small - The speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size. At some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body, and the benefit is lost.

Are there any drawbacks with inline functions?
Conclusion:
Apparently, There is nothing wrong with using inline functions.
But it is worth noting the following points!

Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower. Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause the code size to increase or decrease. Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very large function can dramatically increase code size. On modern processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use of the instruction cache. - Google Guidelines
The speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size. At some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body, and the benefit is lost - Source
There are few situations where an inline function may not work:

For a function returning values; if a return statement exists.
For a function not returning any values; if a loop, switch or goto statement exists. 
If a function is recursive. -Source

The __inline keyword causes a function to be inlined only if you specify the optimize option. If optimize is specified, whether or not __inline is honored depends on the setting of the inline optimizer option. By default, the inline option is in effect whenever the optimizer is run. If you specify optimize , you must also specify the noinline option if you want the __inline keyword to be ignored. -Source

Once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part, you can save them in a hash table or something for later, and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other!

The Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 3-month trial editions are fully-functional, and can be used indefinitely (forever) by setting the system clock back prior to opening VS. Then, when VS is opened, set the system clock forward again so your datetimes aren't screwed up.

You can use Visual Studio to open 3rd-party executables, and browse embedded resources (dialogs, string tables, images, etc) stored within.
Debugging visualizers are not exactly a ""hidden"" feature but they are somewhat neglected, and super-useful, since in addition to using the provided visualizers you can roll your own for specific data sets.

I think the use of opaque context objects (HANDLEs in Win32, FILE*s in C, to name two well-known examples--hell, HANDLEs live on the other side of the kernel-mode barrier, and it really doesn't get much more encapsulated than that) is found in procedural code too; I'm struggling to see how this is something particular to OOP.

HANDLEs (and the rest of the WinAPI) is OOP! C doesn't support OOP very well so there's no special syntax but that doesn't mean it doesn't use the same concepts. WinAPI is in every sense of the word an object-oriented framework.
See, this is the trouble with every single discussion involving OOP or alternative techniques: nobody is clear about the definition, everyone is talking about something else and thus no consensus can be reached. Seems like a waste of time to me.

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).

What do you think the answer to 2 + 3 x 5 is?
Is it (2 + 3) x 5 = 5 x 5 = 25 ?
or 2 + (3 x 5) = 2 + 15 = 17 ?
BODMAS can come to the rescue and give us rules to follow so that we always get the right answer:
(B)rackets (O)rder (D)ivision (M)ultiplication (A)ddition (S)ubtraction
According to BODMAS, multiplication should always be done before addition, therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to BODMAS and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5 .

Why it is useful in programming? No idea, but i assume it's because you can get rid of some brackets? I am a quite defensive programmer, so my lines can look like this:
result = (((i + 4) - (a + b)) * MAGIC_NUMBER) - ANOTHER_MAGIC_NUMBER;

with BODMAS you can make this a bit clearer:
result = (i + 4 - (a + b)) * MAGIC_NUMBER - ANOTHER_MAGIC_NUMBER;

I think i'd still use the first variant - more brackets, but that way i do not have to learn yet another rule and i run into less risk of forgetting it and causing those weird hard to debug errors?
Just guessing at that part though.

This leads me to believe, as a beginning programmer, I should start deciding where I want to specialize after I have general understanding of the basic principles of software development. 
This is a multi-part question really: 

What are the common specializations within computer programming and software development?  
Which of these specializations have more long-term value, both as a foundation for other specializations and/or as marketable skills? 
Which skill sets complement each other? 
Are there any areas of specialization that hinder your ability of developing other areas of specialization.

40121,4050.0,2008-09-02T17:38:58Z,40090,20,"Just to satisfy some curiosity:
From Why doesn't C# support default parameters?:

In languages such as C++, a default value can be included as part of the method declaration:
void Process(Employee employee, bool bonus = false)
This method can be called either with:
a.Process(employee, true);
or
a.Process(employee);
in the second case, the parameter bonus is set to false.
C# doesn't have this feature.
One reason we don't have this feature is related to a specific implementation of the feature. In the C++ world, when the user writes:
a.Process(employee);
the compiler generates
a.process(employee, false);
In other words, the compiler takes the default value that is specified in the method prototype and puts it into the method call - it's just as if the user wrote 'false' as the second parameter. There's no way to change that default value without forcing the user of the class to recompile, which is unfortunate.
The overloading model works better in this respect. The framework author just defines two separate methods, and the single-parameter one calls the two-parameter method. This keeps the default value in the framework, where it can be modified if necessary.
It would be possible for a compiler to take something like the C++ definition and produce the overloads, but there are a few issues with that approach.
The first one is that the correlation between the code that the user writes and the code the compiler generates is less obvious. We generally try to limit magic when possible, as it makes it harder for programmers. The second issue has to do with things like XML doc comments and intellisense. The compiler would have to have special rules for how it generates doc comments for the overloaded methods, and intellisense would need to have smarts to collapse the overloaded methods into a single method.
Writing overloads yourself is a bit less convenient, but we think it's an acceptable solution.

What if you created an abstract base class for a ""multimedia driver"" to handle the back-end stuff (workhorse), and a separate class for the front-end work?  The front-end class could take a pointer/reference to an implemented driver class (for the appropriate media type and situation) and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure.
My philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way, just under the assumption they would be used in tandem.
I would reference something like a QTextDocument in Qt.  You provide a direct interface to the bare metal data handling, but pass the authority along to an object like a QTextEdit to do the manipulation.

I just learned about the existence of nested classes in C++, and I'm curious to know what programmers think about using them. I am a little wary and not really sure what the benefits/drawbacks are, but they seem (according to the book I'm reading) to be used in cases such as mine.
The book suggests that in a scenario like mine, a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class, so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use, and to avoid any possible naming conflicts?

The above is similar to xtofl's, except it guards against passing a pointer to it (that says point to a dynamically allocated array) and getting the wrong answer by mistake.
EDIT: Simplified as per JohnMcG.
EDIT: inline.
Unfortunately, the above does not provide a compile time answer (even if the compiler does inline & optimize it to be a constant under the hood), so cannot be used as a compile time constant expression. i.e. It cannot be used as size to declare a static array. Under C++0x, this problem go away if one replaces the keyword inline by constexpr (constexpr is inline implicitly).
constexpr size_t array_size(const T (&array)[SIZE])

jwfearn's solution work for compile time, but involve having a typedef which effectively ""saved"" the array size in the declaration of a new name. The array size is then worked out by initialising a constant via that new name. In such case, one may as well simply save the array size into a constant from the start.
Martin York's posted solution also work under compile time, but involve using the non-standard typeof() operator. The work around to that is either wait for C++0x and use decltype (by which time one wouldn't actually need it for this problem as we'll have constexpr). Another alternative is to use Boost.Typeof, in which case we'll end up with
#include <boost/typeof/typeof.hpp>

template<typename T>
struct ArraySize
{
    private:    static T x;
    public:     enum { size = sizeof(T)/sizeof(*x)};

You will indeed need multiple statements. Either conditionally create then populate:

TRUNCATE TABLE fubar
INSERT INTO fubar SELECT * FROM barfu

or just drop and recreate

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS fubar

The first time the method containing this is run, it generates an error message on the truncate since the table doesn't exist yet.
Is my only option to do the CREATE TABLE, run the TRUNCATE TABLE, and then fill the table? (3 separate queries)
original question was:

I've been having a hard time trying to figure out if the following is possible in MySql without having to write block sql:
CREATE TABLE fubar IF NOT EXISTS ELSE TRUNCATE TABLE fubar

If I run truncate separately before the create table, and the table doesn't exist, then I get an error message.  I'm trying to eliminate that error message without having to add any more queries.

40630,4100.0,2008-09-02T20:53:59Z,40480,19,"To make a long story short, Java objects have some very peculiar properties.
In general, Java has primitive types (int, bool, char, double, etc) that are passed directly by value. Then Java has objects (everything that derives from java.lang.Object). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can't touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by reference, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.
Does this sound strange and confusing? Let's consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C, the default convention is pass by value. void foo(int x) passes an int by value. void foo(int *x) is a function that does not want an int a, but a pointer to an int: foo(&a). One would use this with the & operator to pass a variable address.
Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: void foo(int &x) is called by foo(a), where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference a should be passed. In Java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by, for example, C++.

The access patterns you will be using and how often each will be used
The relationships between your types
What indices you are going to need
The write patterns you will be using (in order to effectively spread load)

GAE's datastore automatically denormalizes your data. That is, each index contains a (mostly) complete copy of the data, and thus every index adds significantly to time taken to perform a write, and the storage space used.
If this were not the case, designing a Datastore schema would be a lot more work: You would have to think carefully about the primary key for each type, and consider the effect of your decision on the locality of data. For example, when rendering a blog post you would probably need to display the comments to go along with it, so each comment's key would probably begin with the associated post's key.
With Datastore, this is not such a big deal: The query you use will look something like ""Select * FROM Comment WHERE post_id = N."" (If you want to page the comments, you would also have a limit clause, and a possible suffix of "" AND comment_id > last_comment_id"".) Once you add such a query, Datastore will build the index for you, and your reads will be magically fast.
Something to keep in mind is that each additional index creates some additional cost: it is best if you can use as few access patterns as possible, since it will reduce the number of indices GAE will construct, and thus the total storage required by your data.
Reading over this answer, I find it a little vague. Maybe a hands-on design question would help to scope this down? :-)

I am already using the SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy (which is based on TDS) to speed up the data transfer across the wire which helped a lot, but I'm still looking for more.
I have a simple table that looks like this: 
 CREATE TABLE [BulkData](
 [ContainerId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [BinId] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Sequence] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [ItemId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [Left] [smallint] NOT NULL,

 [Bottom] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PKBulkData] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
 (
  [ContainerIdId] ASC,
  [BinId] ASC,
  [Sequence] ASC
))

I'm inserting data in chunks that average about 300 rows where ContainerId and BinId are constant in each chunk and the Sequence value is 0-n and the values are pre-sorted based on the primary key.  
The %Disk time performance counter spends a lot of time at 100% so it is clear that disk IO is the main issue but the speeds I'm getting are several orders of magnitude below a raw file copy.
Does it help any if I:

Drop the Primary key while I am doing the inserting and recreate it later
Do inserts into a temporary table with the same schema and periodically transfer them into the main table to keep the size of the table where insertions are happening small
Anything else?

--
Based on the responses I have gotten, let me clarify a little bit:
Portman: I'm using a clustered index because when the data is all imported I will need to access data sequentially in that order.  I don't particularly need the index to be there while importing the data.  Is there any advantage to having a nonclustered PK index while doing the inserts as opposed to dropping the constraint entirely for import?
Chopeen:  The data is being generated remotely on many other machines (my SQL server can only handle about 10 currently, but I would love to be able to add more).  It's not practical to run the entire process on the local machine because it would then have to process 50 times as much input data to generate the output.
Jason: I am not doing any concurrent queries against the table during the import process, I will try dropping the primary key and see if that helps.

70572,11436.0,2008-09-16T09:07:31Z,47400,17,"I appreciated knox's and david's answers. My answer will be somewhere between theirs: just make forms that do not need to be debugged!
I think that forms should be exclusively used as what they are basically, meaning graphic interface only, meaning here that they do not have to be debugged! The debugging job is then limited to your VBA modules and objects, which is a lot easier to handle. 
There is of course a natural tendency to add VBA code to forms and/or controls, specially when Access offers you these great ""after Update"" and ""on change"" events, but I definitely advise you not to put any form or control specific code in the form's module. This makes further maintenance and upgrade very costy, where your code is split between VBA modules and forms/controls modules.
This does not mean you cannot use anymore this AfterUpdate event! Just put standard code in the event, like this:
Private Sub myControl_AfterUpdate()  
    CTLAfterUpdate myControl
    On Error Resume Next
    Eval (""CTLAfterUpdate_MyForm()"")
    On Error GoTo 0  
End sub

Where:

CTLAfterUpdate is a standard procedure run each time a control is updated in a form
CTLAfterUpdateMyForm is a specific procedure run each time a control is updated on MyForm

I have then 2 modules. The first one is 

utilityFormEvents
 where I will have my CTLAfterUpdate generic event

The second one is 

MyAppFormEvents
 containing the specific code of all specific forms of the MyApp application
 and including the CTLAfterUpdateMyForm procedure. Of course, CTLAfterUpdateMyForm
 might not exist if there are no specific code to run. This is why we turn the 
 ""On error"" to ""resume next"" ...

Choosing such a generic solution means a lot. It means you are reaching a high level of code normalization (meaning painless maintenance of code). And when you say that you do not have any form-specific code,  it also means that form modules are fully standardized, and their production can be automated: just say which events you want to manage at the form/control level, and define your generic/specific procedures terminology.
Write your automation code, once for all.
It takes a few  days of work but it give exciting results. I have been using this solution for the last 2 years and it is clearly the right one: my forms are fully and automatically created from scratch with a ""Forms Table"", linked to a ""Controls Table"".
I can then spend my time working on the specific procedures of the form, if any.
Code normalization, even with MS Access, is a long process. But it is really worth the pain!

so we should see x == 2 afterwards. However this is not actually true, you will find some compilers that have x == 1 afterwards, or maybe even x == 3. You would have to look closely at the generated assembly to see why this might be, but the differences are due to the underlying problem.

""Black box"" testing is what most people think of when you mention Quality Assurance.
I work for a company where the QA team are also software developers.  (That narrows the field a lot if you care to guess the company.)  I know Joel's opinion, and my experience leads me to partially disagree: for the same reason that a ""white hat"" hacker is more effective finding security holes, certain kinds of errors are more effectively found by white box testers who know how to write code (and therefore what the common mistakes are - for example, resource management issues like memory leaks).  
Also, since QA-oriented developers are part of the process from the initial design phase, they can theoretically help to drive higher-quality code throughout the process.  Ideally, for each developer working on the project with a mental focus on functionality, you have an opposing developer with a mental focus on breaking the code (and thus making it better).  
Seen in that light, it's less a matter of using developers for testers than it is kind of disconnected pair-programming where one developer has an emphasis on controlling quality.  
On the other hand, a lot of testing (such as basic UI functionality) frankly doesn't need that kind of skill.  That's where Joel has a point. 
For many businesses, I could see a system where programming teams trade off code review and testing duties for each others' code.  Members of the Business Logic team, for example, could spend an occasional tour testing and reviewing code for the UI team, and vice-versa.  That way you're not ""wasting"" developer talent on full-time testing, but you are gaining the advantages of exposing the code to (hopefully) expert scrutiny and punishment.

Great x-platform support - I've used it on Windows and Linux, and found it easy on both
Solid Documentation - The docs are clear and to the point, with great examples
Deep per-platform support - There are some unique features in the window service management system that are supported perfectly by service wrapper (w/o restarting).  And on Windows, you will even see your app name in the process list instead of just ""java.exe"".
Standards Compliant - Unlike many ad-hoc Java init scripts, the scripts for service wrapper tend to be compliant with LSB standards.  This can end up being very important if you ever want high availability management from something like Linux Heartbeat/HA.

Especially if using a product like VS DB Pro or Team Suite, many of the arguments made here do not apply, for instance:
Harder to maintain and Test:
VS provides full syntax checking, style checking, referential and constraint checking and more. It also provide full unit testing capabilities and refactoring tools.
LINQ makes true unit testing impossible as (in my mind) it fails the ACID test.
Debugging is easier in LINQ:
Why? VS allows full step-in from managed code and regular debugging of SPs.
Compiled into a single DLL rather than deployment scripts:
Once again, VS comes to the rescue where it can build and deploy full databases or make data-safe incremental changes.
Don't have to learn TSQL with LINQ:
No you don't, but you have to learn LINQ - where's the benefit?

I really don't see this as being a benefit. Being able to change something in isolation might sound good in theory, but just because the changes fulfil a contract doesn't mean it's returning the correct results. To be able to determine what the correct results are you need context and you get that context from the calling code.

Um, loosely coupled apps are the ultimate goal of all good programmers as they really do increase flexibility. Being able to change things in isolation is fantastic, and it is your unit tests that will ensure it is still returning appropriate results.
Before you all get upset, I think LINQ has its place and has a grand future. But for complex, data-intensive applications I do not think it is ready to take the place of stored procedures. This was a view I had echoed by an MVP at TechEd this year (they will remain nameless).

A good way to get started is using Selenium IDE as part of your development. Ie, just have the IDE open as you're developing and write your test as you go to cut down on your dev time. (Instead of having to manually go through the UI to get to the point where you can test whatever you're working on, just hit a button and Selenium IDE will take care of that for you. It's a terrific time-saver!)
Most of my major use case scenarios have Selenium RC tests to back them up. You can't really think of them as unit-tests along the lines of an xUnit framework, but they are tests targetted to very specific functionality. They're quick to write (especially if you implement common methods for things like logging in or setting up your test cases), quick to run, and provide a very tight feedback loop. In those senses Selenium RC tests are very similar to unit-tests.
I think, like anything else, if you put the effort into properly learning a test tool (eg, Selenium), your effort will pay off in spades. You mention that your company already uses Selenium to do UI testing. This is great. Work with it. If you find Selenium hard to use, or confusing, stick with it. The learning curve really isn't all that steep once you learn the API a little bit.
If I'm working on a web app, its rare for me to write a significant amount of code without Selenium RC tests to back it up. That's how effective I find Selenium. :) (Hopefully that'll answer your question..)

The form will be used to display information to the screen. Eventually it will be asynchronous and expose a lot of customization in the dll. For now I just want it to display properly. The problem that I am having is that I use the dll by loading it in a Powershell session. So when I try to display the form and get it to come to the top and have focus, It has no problem with displaying over all the other apps, but I can't for the life of me get it to display over the Powershell window. Here is the code that I am currently using to try and get it to display. I am sure that the majority of it won't be required once I figure it out, this just represents all the things that I found via google.

As I say I'm sure that most of that is either not needed or even flat out wrong, I just wanted to show the things that I had tried. Also, as I mentioned, I plan to have this be asynchronously displayed at some point which I suspect will wind up requiring a separate thread. Would splitting the form out into it's own thread make it easier to cause it to get focus over the Powershell session? 

@Joel, thanks for the info. Here is what I tried based on your suggestion:
msgFrm.ShowDialog();
msgFrm.BringToFront();
msgFrm.Focus();
Application.DoEvents();

The form still comes up under the Powershell session. I'll proceed with working out the threading. I've spawned threads before but never where the parent thread needed to talk to the child thread, so we'll see how it goes.
Thnks for all the ideas so far folks.

Ok, threading it took care of the problem. @Quarrelsome, I did try both of those. Neither (nor both together) worked. I am curious as to what is evil about using threading? I am not using Application.Run and I have yet to have a problem. I am using a mediator class that both the parent thread and the child thread have access to. In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates. The parent locks the property then writes what should be displayed. The child thread locks the property and reads what it should change the label on the form to. The child has to do this on a polling interval (I default it to 500ms) which I'm not real happy about, but I could not find an event driven way to let the child thread know that the proerty had changed, so I'm stuck with polling.

Specifically, I need to convert from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-15 and vice versa.
Everything goes: one-liners in your favorite scripting language, command-line tools or other utilities for OS, web sites, etc.
Best solutions so far:
On Linux/UNIX/OS X/cygwin:

Gnu iconv suggested by Troels Arvin is best used as a filter. It seems to be universally available. Example:
$ iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-15 in.txt > out.txt

As pointed out by Ben, there is an online converter using iconv.
Gnu recode (manual) suggested by Cheekysoft will convert one or several files in-place. Example:
$ recode UTF8..ISO-8859-15 in.txt

This one uses shorter aliases:
$ recode utf8..l9 in.txt

Recode also supports surfaces which can be used to convert between different line ending types and encodings:
Convert newlines from LF (Unix) to CR-LF (DOS):
$ recode ../CR-LF in.txt

Base64 encode file:
$ recode ../Base64 in.txt

You can also combine them.
Convert a Base64 encoded UTF8 file with Unix line endings to Base64 encoded Latin 1 file with Dos line endings:
$ recode utf8/Base64..l1/CR-LF/Base64 file.txt


On Windows with Powershell (Jay Bazuzi): 

PS C:\> gc -en utf8 in.txt | Out-File -en ascii out.txt
(No ISO-8859-15 support though; it says that supported charsets are unicode, utf7, utf8, utf32, ascii, bigendianunicode, default, and oem.)

Edit
Do you mean iso-8859-1 support? Using ""String"" does this e.g. for vice versa
gc -en string in.txt | Out-File -en utf8 out.txt

Note: The possible enumeration values are ""Unknown, String, Unicode, Byte, BigEndianUnicode, UTF8, UTF7, Ascii"".

CsCvt - Kalytta's Character Set Converter is another great command line based conversion tool for Windows.

The PIMPL Idiom (Pointer to IMPLementation) is a technique for implementation hiding in which a public class wraps a structure or class that cannot be seen outside the library the public class is part of.
This hides internal implementation details and data from the user of the library.
When implementing this idiom why would you place the public methods on the pimpl class and not the public class since the public classes method implementations would be compiled into the library and the user only has the header file?
To illustrate, this code puts the Purr() implementation on the impl class and wraps it as well.
Why not implement Purr directly on the public class?

58450,6042.0,2008-09-12T07:30:04Z,58280,15,"Ok, Iâve done  a little more research into this now.
When you create a windows service in .Net, you create a class that inherits from System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase (In VB this is hidden in the .Designer.vb file). You then override the OnStart and OnStop function, and OnPause and OnContinue if you choose to. 
These methods are invoked from within the base class so I did a little poking around with reflector.
OnStart is invoked by a method in System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase called ServiceQueuedMainCallback.  The vesion on my machine ""System.ServiceProcess, Version=2.0.0.0"" decompiles like this:


Private Sub ServiceQueuedMainCallback(ByVal state As Object)
    Dim args As String() = DirectCast(state, String())
    Try 
        Me.OnStart(args)
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartSuccessful""))
        Me.status.checkPoint = 0
        Me.status.waitHint = 0
        Me.status.currentState = 4
    Catch exception As Exception
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartFailed"", New Object() { exception.ToString }), EventLogEntryType.Error)
        Me.status.currentState = 1
    Catch obj1 As Object
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartFailed"", New Object() { String.Empty }), EventLogEntryType.Error)
        Me.status.currentState = 1
    End Try
    Me.startCompletedSignal.Set
End Sub


So because Me.OnStart(args) is called from within the Try portion of a Try Catch block I assume that anything that happens within the OnStart method is effectively wrapped by that Try Catch block and therefore any exceptions that occur aren't technically unhandled as they are actually handled in the ServiceQueuedMainCallback Try Catch. So CurrentDomain.UnhandledException never actually happens at least during the startup routine. 
The other 3 entry points (OnStop, OnPause and OnContinue) are all called from the base class in a similar way.
So I âthinkâ that explains why my Exception Handling component canât catch UnhandledException on Start and Stop, but Iâm not sure if it explains why timers that are setup in OnStart canât cause an UnhandledException when they fire.

Normally I would use a custom built Exception Handling Component that does logging, phone home, etc. This component adds a handler to System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException but as far as I can tell this doesnât achieve anything win a Windows Service so I end up with this pattern in my 2 (or 4) Service entry points:


    Protected Overrides Sub OnStart(ByVal args() As String)
        ' Add code here to start your service. This method should set things
        ' in motion so your service can do its work.
        Try
            MyServiceComponent.Start()

            'call into our exception handler

            'we pass an exit code here as well, just in case.
            System.Environment.Exit(-1)

I want to be able to generate a new (fully valid) MP3 file from an existing MP3 file to be used as a preview -- try-before-you-buy style. The new file should only contain the first n seconds of the track.

Anyone any ideas?
Answers
Both mp3split and ffmpeg are both good solutions. I chose ffmpeg as it is commonly installed on linux servers and is also easily available for windows.  Here's some more good command line parameters for generating previews with ffmpeg

-t <seconds> chop after specified number of seconds
-y force file overwrite
-ab <bitrate> set bitrate e.g. -ab 96k
-ar <rate Hz> set sampling rate e.g. -ar 22050 for 22.05kHz
-map_meta_data <outfile>:<infile> copy track metadata from infile to outfile

instead of setting -ab and -ar, you can copy the original track settings, as Tim Farley suggests, with:

All you need is a little basic knowledge and some tools.
There are already tools that will tell you if a word in a sentence is a noun, adjective or verb. They are called part-of-speech taggers. Typically, they take plaintext English as input, and output the word, its base form, and the part-of-speech. Here is the output of a popular UNIX part-of-speech tagger on the first sentence of your post:
$ echo ""Without getting a degree in information retrieval, I'd like to know if there exists any algorithms for counting the frequency that words occur in a given body of text."" | tree-tagger-english 
# Word  POS 	surface form

.   SENT	.

As you can see, it identified ""algorithms"" as being the plural form (NNS) of ""algorithm"" and ""exists"" as being a conjugation (VBZ) of ""exist."" It also identified ""a"" and ""the"" as ""determiners (DT)"" -- another word for article. As you can see, the POS tagger also tokenized the punctuation.
To do everything but the last point on your list, you just need to run the text through a POS tagger, filter out the categories that don't interest you (determiners, pronouns, etc.) and count the frequencies of the base forms of the words.
Here are some popular POS taggers:
TreeTagger (binary only: Linux, Solaris, OS-X)
GENIA Tagger (C++: compile your self)
Stanford POS Tagger (Java)  
To do the last thing on your list, you need more than just word-level information. An easy way to start is by counting sequences of words rather than just words themselves. These are called n-grams. A good place to start is UNIX for Poets. If you are willing to invest in a book on NLP, I would recommend Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing.

As I say I'm sure that most of that is either not needed or even flat out wrong, I just wanted to show the things that I had tried. Also, as I mentioned, I plan to have this be asynchronously displayed at some point which I suspect will wind up requiring a separate thread. Would splitting the form out into it's own thread make it easier to cause it to get focus over the Powershell session? 

@Joel, thanks for the info. Here is what I tried based on your suggestion:
msgFrm.ShowDialog();
msgFrm.BringToFront();
msgFrm.Focus();
Application.DoEvents();

The form still comes up under the Powershell session. I'll proceed with working out the threading. I've spawned threads before but never where the parent thread needed to talk to the child thread, so we'll see how it goes.
Thnks for all the ideas so far folks.

Ok, threading it took care of the problem. @Quarrelsome, I did try both of those. Neither (nor both together) worked. I am curious as to what is evil about using threading? I am not using Application.Run and I have yet to have a problem. I am using a mediator class that both the parent thread and the child thread have access to. In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates. The parent locks the property then writes what should be displayed. The child thread locks the property and reads what it should change the label on the form to. The child has to do this on a polling interval (I default it to 500ms) which I'm not real happy about, but I could not find an event driven way to let the child thread know that the proerty had changed, so I'm stuck with polling.

The biggest change you will find migrating to SVN is the idea of ""Check out"" and ""Check in"" aren't exactly the same as ""Update"" and ""Commit"". . . thus, any IDE integration with VB6 is limited because VB6 supports MSSCCI, a check-out/check-in mechanism.

As you can see, it is somewhat desirable to not need to do this manually.
So far I've only tried AutoJar and ProGuard, both of which were fairly easy to get running. It appears that there's some issue with the constant pool in the JAR files.
Apparently jrst is slightly broken, so I'll make a go of fixing it. The Maven pom.xml file was apparently broken too, so I'll have to fix that before fixing jrst ... I feel like a bug-magnet :-)

Update: I never got around to fixing this application, but I checked out Eclipse's ""Runnable JAR export wizard"" which is based on a fat JAR. I found this very easy to use for deploying my own code.
Some of the other excellent suggestions might be better for builds in a non-Eclipse environment, oss probably should make a nice build using Ant. (Maven, so far has just given me pain, but others love it.)

I think it's usually OK if the

Edit: Here's what the linux CodingStyle document says about it:

Chapter 15: The inline disease
There appears to be a common
  misperception that gcc has a magic
  ""make me faster"" speedup option called
  ""inline"". While the use of inlines can
  be appropriate (for example as a means
  of replacing macros, see Chapter 12),
  it very often is not. Abundant use of
  the inline keyword leads to a much
  bigger kernel, which in turn slows the
  system as a whole down, due to a
  bigger icache footprint for the CPU
  and simply because there is less
  memory available for the pagecache.
  Just think about it; a pagecache miss
  causes a disk seek, which easily takes
  5 miliseconds. There are a LOT of cpu
  cycles that can go into these 5
  miliseconds.
A reasonable rule of thumb is to not
  put inline at functions that have more
  than 3 lines of code in them. An
  exception to this rule are the cases
  where a parameter is known to be a
  compiletime constant, and as a result
  of this constantness you know the
  compiler will be able to optimize most
  of your function away at compile time.
  For a good example of this later case,
  see the kmalloc() inline function.
Often people argue that adding inline
  to functions that are static and used
  only once is always a win since there
  is no space tradeoff. While this is
  technically correct, gcc is capable of
  inlining these automatically without
  help, and the maintenance issue of
  removing the inline when a second user
  appears outweighs the potential value
  of the hint that tells gcc to do
  something it would have done anyway.

",60830,123.0,2008-09-13T20:25:07Z,,33,What is wrong with using inline functions?,"While it would be very convenient to use inline functions at some situations,
Are there any drawbacks with inline functions?
Conclusion:
Apparently, There is nothing wrong with using inline functions.
But it is worth noting the following points!

Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower. Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause the code size to increase or decrease. Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very large function can dramatically increase code size. On modern processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use of the instruction cache. - Google Guidelines
The speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size. At some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body, and the benefit is lost - Source
There are few situations where an inline function may not work:

For a function returning values; if a return statement exists.
For a function not returning any values; if a loop, switch or goto statement exists. 
If a function is recursive. -Source

The __inline keyword causes a function to be inlined only if you specify the optimize option. If optimize is specified, whether or not __inline is honored depends on the setting of the inline optimizer option. By default, the inline option is in effect whenever the optimizer is run. If you specify optimize , you must also specify the noinline option if you want the __inline keyword to be ignored. -Source

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).

Solution
The general solution is this answer.
The specific solution to extending the System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage class is my answer below, which started from the general solution.
The difference is in the specific case you need both a generically typed method declaration AND a statement to enforce the generic type as a reference type.

24308,1553.0,2008-08-23T15:43:04Z,24270,14,"Relative to straight procedural programming, the first fundamental tenet of OOP is the notion of information hiding and encapsulation. This idea leads to the notion of the class that seperates the interface from implementation. These are hugely important concepts and the basis for putting a framework in place to think about program design in a different way and better (I think) way. You can't really argue against those properties - there is no trade-off made and it is always a cleaner way to modulize things.
Other aspects of OOP including inheritance and polymorphism are important too, but as others have alluded to, those are commonly over used. ie: Sometimes people use inheritance and/or polymorphism because they can, not because they should have. They are powerful concepts and very useful, but need to be used wisely and are not automatic winning advantages of OOP.
Relative to re-use. I agree re-use is over sold for OOP. It is a possible side effect of well defined objects, typically of more primitive/generic classes and is a direct result of the encapsulation and information hiding concepts. It is potentially easier to be re-used because the interfaces of well defined classes are just simply clearer and somewhat self documenting.
",24270,2131.0,2008-08-23T14:40:28Z,,126,What's the point of OOP?,"As far as I can tell, in spite of the countless millions or billions spent on OOP education, languages, and tools, OOP has not improved developer productivity or software reliability, nor has it reduced development costs. Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).
So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?

Some details about it are mentioned below:
http://www.bloombit.com/Articles/2008/05/ASCII-Encoded-Binary-String-Automated-SQL-Injection.aspx 
The nasty thing about this is that effectively every varchar type field in the database is ""infected"" to spit out a reference to this URL, in which the the browser gets an tiny iframe that turns it into a bot. A basic SQL fix for this can be found here:
http://aspadvice.com/blogs/programming_shorts/archive/2008/06/27/Asprox-Recovery.aspx
The scary thing though is that the virus looks to the system tables for values to infect and a lot of shared hosting plans also share the database space for their clients. So most likely it wasn't even your dad's site that was infected, but somebody else's site within his hosting cluster that wrote some poor code and opened the door to SQL Injection attack.
If he hasn't done so yet, I'd send an URGENT e-mail to their host and give them a link to that SQL code to fix the entire system. You can fix your own affected database tables, but most likely the bots that are doing the infection are going to pass right through that hole again and infect the whole lot.

34578,3575.0,2008-08-29T16:12:09Z,34510,14,"Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications or multi-process systems.  A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do.  This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access.  There's almost always a race condition when one thread calls sleep to give another thread time to finish a task (unless that sleep is in a loop, with some checking mechanism).
Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals.  Mutexes are good when you want to make sure you're the only one doing something.  Signals are good when you want to make sure someone else has finished doing something.  Minimizing shared resources can also help prevent unexpected behaviors
Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs.  Code which relies heavily on sleeps is prone to race conditions, so first check for calls to sleep in the affected code.  Adding particularly long sleeps can also be used for debugging to try and force a particular order of events.  This can be useful for reproducing the behavior, seeing if you can make it disappear by changing the timing of things, and for testing solutions put in place.  The sleeps should be removed after debugging.
The signature sign that one has a race condition though, is if there's an issue that only occurs intermittently on some machines.  Common bugs would be crashes and deadlocks.  With logging, you should be able to find the affected area and work back from there.

One note, I had a series of classloader problems when I used apache commons logging in addition to log4j.  It was only for one specific application, but I found it simpler to use log4j alone, rather than to have the flexibility offered when using an abstraction layer like commons logging.

Specifically, I need to convert from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-15 and vice versa.
Everything goes: one-liners in your favorite scripting language, command-line tools or other utilities for OS, web sites, etc.
Best solutions so far:
On Linux/UNIX/OS X/cygwin:

Gnu iconv suggested by Troels Arvin is best used as a filter. It seems to be universally available. Example:
$ iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-15 in.txt > out.txt

As pointed out by Ben, there is an online converter using iconv.
Gnu recode (manual) suggested by Cheekysoft will convert one or several files in-place. Example:
$ recode UTF8..ISO-8859-15 in.txt

This one uses shorter aliases:
$ recode utf8..l9 in.txt

Recode also supports surfaces which can be used to convert between different line ending types and encodings:
Convert newlines from LF (Unix) to CR-LF (DOS):
$ recode ../CR-LF in.txt

Base64 encode file:
$ recode ../Base64 in.txt

You can also combine them.
Convert a Base64 encoded UTF8 file with Unix line endings to Base64 encoded Latin 1 file with Dos line endings:
$ recode utf8/Base64..l1/CR-LF/Base64 file.txt


On Windows with Powershell (Jay Bazuzi): 

PS C:\> gc -en utf8 in.txt | Out-File -en ascii out.txt
(No ISO-8859-15 support though; it says that supported charsets are unicode, utf7, utf8, utf32, ascii, bigendianunicode, default, and oem.)

Edit
Do you mean iso-8859-1 support? Using ""String"" does this e.g. for vice versa
gc -en string in.txt | Out-File -en utf8 out.txt

Note: The possible enumeration values are ""Unknown, String, Unicode, Byte, BigEndianUnicode, UTF8, UTF7, Ascii"".

A simple templating engine, like StringTemplate, or even XSLT outputting HTML would be fine.  The problem I'm having is finding a free way to print this kind of output from a service.  Since it seems that it will work, I'm working on a prototype using Microsoft's RDLC, populating a local report and then rendering it as an image to a memory stream, which I will then print.  Issues with that are:

Multi-page printing will be a big headache.
Still have to use PrintDocument to print the memory stream, which is unsupported in a Windows Service (though it may work - haven't gotten that far with the prototype yet)
If the data coming across changes, I have to change the dataset, and the class that the data is being deserialized into.  bad bad bad.

Has anyone had to do anything remotely like this?  Any advice?  I already posed a question about printing HTML without user input, and after wasting about 3 days on that, I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be done, at least not with any freely available tool.

Anyway, PostgreSQL documentation has a chapter on GIST and one on GIN, where you can find more info.
And, last but not least, the best way to find which is best is to generate sample data (as much as you need to be a real scenario) and then create a GIST index, measuring how much time is needed to create the index, insert a new value, execute a sample query. Then drop the index and do the same with a GIN index. Compare the values and you will have the answer you need, based on your data.

GIN index lookups are about three times faster than GiST
GIN indexes take about three times longer to build than GiST
GIN indexes are about ten times slower to update than GiST
GIN indexes are two-to-three times larger than GiST

However I would be particularly interested to know if there is a performance impact when the memory to index size ration starts getting small (ie. the index size becomes much bigger than the available memory)? I've been told on the #postgresql IRC channel that GIN needs to keep all the index in memory, otherwise it won't be effective, because, unlike B-Tree, it doesn't know which part to read in from disk for a particular query?

A lot of important work went into standardizing the C library, too.  Even though the standard C library was a codification of existing practice, it codified multiple existing practices, which made it more difficult.  P.J. Plauger's book, The Standard C Library, is a great reference, and also tells some of the behind-the-scenes details of why the library ended up the way it did.
The ANSI/ISO standard C is very similar to K&R C in most ways.  It was intended that most existing C code should build on ANSI compilers without many changes.  Crucially, though, in the pre-standard era, the semantics of the language were open to interpretation by each compiler vendor.  ANSI C brought in a common description of language semantics which put all the compilers on an equal footing.  It's easy to take this for granted now, some 20 years later, but this was a significant achievement.
For the most part, if you don't have a pre-standard C codebase to maintain, you should be glad you don't have to worry about it.  If you do--or worse yet, if you're trying to bring an old program up to more modern standards--then you have my sympathies.

However, the standards committee also included several new features, such as function prototypes (borrowed from the C++ programming language), and a more capable preprocessor. The syntax for parameter declarations was also changed to reflect the C++ style.

That makes me think that there are differences. However, I didn't see a comparison between K&R C and ANSI C. Is there such a document? If not, what are the major differences?

You can also do this without the YUI library and Hack control.

The YUI control gives it that nice animation but it's not necessary. This task can also be accomplished with jquery and other libraries (although, I haven't found explicit documentation for this)

As you guessed, first you count how many times words appear in the text (usually called document in the NLP-lingo). Then you throw out the so called stop words, such as ""the"", ""a"", ""or"" and so on.
You're left with words and word counts. Do this for a while and you get a comprehensive set of words that appear in your documents. You can then create an index for these words:
""aardvark"" is 1, ""apple"" is 2, ..., ""z-index"" is 70092. 
Now you can take your word bags and turn them into vectors. For example, if your document contains two references for aardvarks and nothing else, it would look like this:
[2 0 0 ... 70k zeroes ... 0].

After this you can count the ""angle"" between the two vectors with a dot product. The smaller the angle, the closer the documents are.

So suppose you're in a situation where you want to update an object and then return its current value.
instead of saying 
myObj.Update();

you will be able to combine the two lines to say
var val = myObj.Update().GetCurrentValue();


EDIT:  I asked the below on a whim, in retrospect, I agree that its likely to be unnecessary and complicating, however my question regarding returning this rather than void stands.
On a related note, what do you guys think of having the language include a new bit of syntactic sugar:
var val = myObj.Update()<.GetCurrentValue();

This operator would have a low order of precedence so myObj.Update() would execute first and then call  GetCurrentValue() on myObj instead of the void return of Update.
Essentially I'm imagining an operator that will say ""call the method on the right-hand side of the operator on the first valid object on the left"".  Any thoughts?

As such, it uses asynchronous callbacks for all the calls to the methods of the service.  If the service is not running, or it crashes, or the network goes down, etc before or during one of these calls, an exception is generated as you would expect.  The problem is, I don't know how to catch this exception.

Because it is an asynchronous call, I can't wrap my begin call with a try/catch block and have it pick up an exception that happens after the program has moved on from that point.
Because the service proxy is automatically generated, I can't put a try/catch block on each and every generated function that calls EndInvoke (where the exception actually shows up).  These generated functions are also surrounded by External Code in the call stack, so there's nowhere else in the stack to put a try/catch either.
I can't put the try/catch in my callback functions, because the exception occurs before they would get called.
There is an Application_UnhandledException function in my App.xaml.cs, which captures all unhandled exceptions.  I could use this, but it seems like a messy way to do it.  I'd rather reserve this function for the truly unexpected errors (aka bugs) and not end up with code in this function for every circumstance I'd like to deal with in a specific way.

Am I missing an obvious solution?  Or am I stuck using Application_UnhandledException?
[Edit]
As mentioned below, the Error property is exactly what I was looking for.  What is throwing me for a loop is that the fact that the exception is thrown and appears to be uncaught, yet execution is able to continue.  It triggers the Application_UnhandledException event and causes VS2008 to break execution, but continuing in the debugger allows execution to continue.  It's not really a problem, it just seems odd.

Sometimes session.Close works, e.g., it commits all the changes that I need. I know I need to use commit when I have a transaction, or a unit of work with several creates/updates/deletes, so that I can choose to rollback if an error occurs.
But sometimes I really get stymied by the logic behind session.Flush. I have seen examples where you have a session.SaveOrUpdate() followed by a flush, but when I remove Flush it works fine anyway. Sometimes I run into errors on the Flush statement saying that the session timed out, and removing it made sure that I didn't run into that error.
Does anyone have a good guideline as to where or when to use a Flush? I've checked out the NHibernate documentation for this, but I still can't find a straightforward answer.

But it's also much more limiting -- [A-Za-z] does not match accented international characters, it's literally the A-Za-z ASCII set and nothing more.
I don't know if you saw Tim Bray's answer to my message, but it's a good one:

One of the trickiest issues in internationalized search is upper and lower case. This notion of case is limited to languages written in the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic character sets. English-speakers naturally expect search to be case-insensitive if only because theyâre lazy: if Nadia Jones wants to look herself up on Google sheâll probably just type in nadia jones and expect the system to take care of it.
So itâs fairly common for search systems to ânormalizeâ words by converting them all to lower- or upper-case, both for indexing and queries.
The trouble is that the mapping between cases is not always as straightforward as it is in English. For example, the German lower-case character âÃâ becomes âSSâ when upper-cased, and good old capital âIâ when down-cased in Turkish becomes the dotless âÄ±â (yes, they have âiâ, its upper-case version is âÄ°â). I have read (but not verified first-hand) that the rules for upcasing accented characters such âÃ©â are different in France and QuÃ©bec. One of the results of all this is that software such as java.String.toLowerCase() tends to run astonishingly slow as it tries to work around all these corner-cases.

Given that, I would set up Subversion to require ""locking"" on .frx files.  This means that only one person can check the file out at a time.  By doing so, you will enforce that only one developer can modify these files at a time, and it is always clear who that person currently is.

HANDLEs (and the rest of the WinAPI) is OOP!

Are they, though? They're not inheritable, they're certainly not substitutable, they lack well-defined classes... I think they fall a long way short of ""OOP"".

Have you ever created a window using WinAPI? Then you should know that you define a class (RegisterClass), create an instance of it (CreateWindow), call virtual methods (WndProc) and base-class methods (DefWindowProc) and so on. WinAPI even takes the nomenclature from SmallTalk OOP, calling the methods âmessagesâ (Window Messages).
Handles may not be inheritable but then, there's final in Java. They don't lack a class, they are a placeholder for the class: That's what the word âhandleâ means. Looking at architectures like MFC or .NET WinForms it's immediately obvious that except for the syntax, nothing much is different from the WinAPI.

If you don't know which process has the file locked, you'll need to examine each process's handle list, and query each handle to determine if it identifies the locked file. Doing this in C# will likely require P/Invoke or an intermediary C++/CLI to call the native APIs you'll need.
Once you've figured out which process(es) have the file locked, you'll need to safely inject a small native DLL into the process (you can also inject a managed DLL, but this is messier, as you then have to start or attach to the .NET runtime).
That bootstrap DLL then closes the handle using CloseHandle etc.
Essentially: the way to unlock a ""locked"" file is to inject a DLL into the offending process's address space and close it yourself. You can do this using native or managed code. No matter what, you're going to need a small amount of native code or at least P/Invoke into the same.

If your employee table has 10,000 records, and only 5 records have employeetypeID in (1,2,3), then it will most likely use the index to fetch the records.  However, if it finds that 9,000 records have the employeeIDType in (1,2,3), then it would most likely just do a table scan to get the corresponding EmployeeIDs, as it's faster just to run through the whole table than to go to each branch of the index tree and look at the records individually.  
SQL Server does a lot of stuff to try and optimize how the queries run.  However, sometimes it doesn't get the right answer.  If you know that SQL Server isn't using the index, by looking at the execution plan in query analyzer, you can tell the query engine to use a specific index with the following change to your query.
Select EmployeeId From Employee WITH (Index(Index_EmployeeTypeId )) Where EmployeeTypeId IN (1,2,3)

Use variadic parameters (...). Given my lack of experience with variadic parameters in C, I'm not sure if you can use this with a function pointer, but this gives even more flexibility than the first solution, albeit still with the lack of type safety.

chess_move getNextMove(chess_game* game, int depth){

  foreachMove(moveHandler, game);

void moveHandler(chess_move* move){

This means that Tkinter applications will look the same on any platform â this might sound appealing, but in practice, it means they look ugly on any platform :-/  Nevertheless, it's pretty easy to use.  I found Thinking in Tkinter very helpful when I was learning, because I'd never done any GUI programming before.  If things like frames and layout algorithms and buttons and bindings are familiar to you, though, you can skip that step.
You can augment Tkinter with Tix (but be warned, Tix doesn't play well with py2exe).  Also check out Python Megawidgets, which builds some more advanced controls using the Tkinter basics.
Finally, Tkinter plays nice with the shell: you can start the interpreter, do things like 'import tkinter' 'tk = tkinter.Tk()' etc. and build your GUI interactively (and it will be responsive).  (I think this doesn't work if you use IDLE, though)
wxPython is much better looking, and ships with a much greater range of controls.  It's cross-platform (though it seems a bit finicky on my Mac) and uses native controls on each platform.  It's a bit confusing, though.  It also ships with a demo application that shows off most of its features, and provides a test-bed for you to experiment.  Some specific thoughts on wxPython:

There are three (?) different ways to lay widgets out.  Ignore two of them; just use Sizers.  And even then, you can do just about any layout using only BoxSizer and GridBagSizer.
All wx widgets have IDs.  You don't need to care what the IDs are, but in the old days (I think) you did need to know, so some old code will be littered with explicit ID assignments.  And most demo code will have -1 everywhere as the ID parameter (despite the fact that the methods all have ID as a keyword parameter that defaults to -1 anyway).
Make sure you get the standard wxWidgets docs as well as the wxPython Demo â you need them both.
If you want to use wxPython with py2exe and you want it to look good on Windows XP, you need a bit of trickery in your setup.py.  See here

May become complex or clumsy over time if more behavior and relations are added.

If you're really concerned about every clock cycle, you'd never write generic/dynamic game logic. It's a trade off between maintainable/configurable code and outright speed.

I am fairly impressed, however as I continue to piece together a game engine, I have a (probably) basic question.
How much should you rely on C#'s Delegates and Events to drive the game? As an application programmer, I use delegates and events heavily, but I don't know if there is a significant overhead to doing so.
In my game engine, I have designed a ""chase cam"" of sorts, that can be attached to an object and then recalculates its position relative to the object. When the object moves, there are two ways to update the chase cam.

Have an ""UpdateCameras()"" method in the main game loop.
Use an event handler, and have the chase cam subscribe to object.OnMoved.

I'm using the latter, because it allows me to chain events together and nicely automate large parts of the engine. Suddenly, what would be huge and complex get dropped down to a handful of 3-5 line event handlers...Its a beauty.
However, if event handlers firing every nanosecond turn out to be a major slowdown, I'll remove it and go with the loop approach.

My current solution, which sucks, is to send the datetimes into a UDF to convert them to midnight of the same day, and then check those dates for equality.  When it comes to the query plan, this is a disaster, as are almost all UDFs in joins or where clauses.  This is one of the only places in my application that I haven't been able to root out the functions and give the query optimizer something it can actually use to locate the best index.
In this case, merging the function code back into the query seems impractical.
I think I am missing something simple here.
Here's the function for reference.
if not exists (select * from dbo.sysobjects 
              where id = object_id(N'dbo.f_MakeDate') and

    @Hour int, 
    @Minute int

returns datetime

declare @retval datetime
set @retval = cast(

    ' ' + 
    cast(@Hour as varchar(2)) + 
    ':' + 
    cast(@Minute as varchar(2)) as datetime)
return @retval
end

go

To complicate matters, I am joining on time zone tables to check the date against the local time, which could be different for every row:
where 
dbo.f_MakeDate(dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), 0, 0) = @activityDateMidnight

[Edit]
I'm incorporating @Todd's suggestion:
where datediff(day, dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), @ActivityDate) = 0

My misconception about how datediff works (the same day of year in consecutive years yields 366, not 0 as I expected) caused me to waste a lot of effort.
But the query plan didn't change.  I think I need to go back to the drawing board with the whole thing.

(script 2> /dev/null)

which will lose all error messages, but just from that script, not from anything else run in that shell.
You can save and restore standard error, by redirecting a new filedescriptor to point there:

25098,2663.0,2008-08-24T14:57:43Z,24270,10,"In my experience of reviewing code and design of projects I have been through, the value of OOP is not fully realised because alot of developers have not properly conceptualised the object-oriented model in their minds. Thus they do not program with OO design, very often continuing to write top-down procedural code making the classes a pretty flat design. (if you can even call that ""design"" in the first place)
It is pretty scary to observe how little colleagues know about what an abstract class or interface are, let alone properly design an inheritance hierarchy to suit the business needs.
However, when good OO design is present, it is just sheer joy reading the code and seeing the code naturally fall into place into intuitive components/classes. I have always perceived system architecture and design like designing the various departments and staff jobs in a company - all are there to accomplish a certain piece of work in the grand scheme of things, emitting the synergy required to propel the organisation/system forward.
That, of course, is quite rare unfortunately. Like the ratio of beautifully-designed versus horrendously-designed physical objects in the world, the same can pretty much be said about software engineering and design. Having the good tools at one's disposal does not necessarily confer good practices and results.

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).

I'm only saying the following based on the title and your question, but:
Bear in mind that classes provide the advantage of methods and access control, as well. So if you wanted to ensure that people weren't changing weights to negative numbers, you could make the weight field private and provide some accessor methods, like getWeight() and setWeight(). Inside setWeight(), you could do some value checking, like so:
public function setWeight($weight)
{
    if($weight >= 0)
    {
        $this->weight = $weight;

Assuming that somebody doesn't come out and show that classes are too slow, it looks like class wins.
I've not idea which answer I should accept to I've just upvoted all of them.

And I have now written two near identical pages, one using the 2D array (written before this question was posted) and now one using a class and I must say that the class produces much nicer code.

OS dependent
Not quite clear what you're trying to do.

Nevertheless, I'll try to provide some information for you to decide.
On UNIX, fork() creates a clone of your process from the place where you called fork. Meaning, if I have the following process:
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf( ""hi 2 u\n"" );
    int mypid = fork();

    if( 0 == mypid )
        printf( ""lol child\n"" );
    else
        printf( ""lol parent\n"" );

    return( 0 );
}

The output will look as follows:


hi 2 u
    lol child
    lol parent  


When you fork() the pid returned in the child is 0, and the pid returned in the parent is the child's pid. Notice that ""hi2u"" is only printed once... by the parent.
execve() and its family of functions are almost always used with fork(). execve() and the like overwrite the current stackframe with the name of the application you pass to it. execve() is almost always used with fork() where you fork a child process and if you're the parent you do whatever you need to keep doing and if you're the child you exec a new process. execve() is also almost always used with waitpid() -- waitpid takes a pid of a child process and, quite literally, waits until the child terminates and returns the child's exit status to you.  
Using this information, you should be able to write a very basic shell; one that takes process names on the command line and runs processes you tell it to. Of course, shells do more than that, like piping input and output, but you should be able to accomplish the basics using fork(), execve() and waitpid().

There seems to be a lot of confusion over OpenID.  Its original goal was simply to provide a standard login mechanism so that, when I need a secure login mechanism, I can select from any or all OpenID providers to handle that for me.  Allowing anyone anywhere to set up their own trusted OpenID provider was never the goal.  Doing the second effectively is impossible—after all, even with encryption, there's no reason you can't set up your own provider to securely lie and say it's authenticating whomever you want.  Having a single, standardized login mechanism is itself already a great step forward.

A site that supports OpenID basically accepts any OpenID provider out there, right?  How does that work with sites that want to reduce bot-signups?  What's to stop a malicious OpenID provider from setting up unlimited bot IDs automatically?

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).
So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html
That being said, once you are satisifed with your indexes and have exhausted all other avenues, de-normalization might be the right answer.  If you just have one or two queries that are problems, a manual approach is probably appropriate, whereas some sort of data warehousing tool might be better for creating a platform to develop data cubes.
Here's a site I found that touches on the subject:
http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D
Here's a simple technique that you can use to keep denormalizing queries simple, if you're just doing a few at a time (and I'm not replacing your OLTP tables, just creating a new one for reporting purposes).  Let's say you have this query in your application:
select a.name, b.address from tbla a 
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id where a.id=1

You could create a denormalized table and populate with almost the same query:
create table tbl_ab (a_id, a_name, b_address); 
-- (types elided)

Notice the underscores match the table aliases you use
insert tbl_ab select a.id, a.name, b.address from tbla a
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id 
-- no where clause because you want everything

Then to fix your app to use the new denormalized table, switch the dots for underscores.  
select a_name as name, b_address as address 
from tbl_ab where a_id = 1;

For huge queries this can save a lot of time and makes it clear where the data came from, and you can re-use the queries you already have.
Remember, I'm only advocating this as the last resort.  I bet there's a few indexes that would help you.  And when you de-normalize, don't forget to account for the extra space on your disks, and figure out when you will run the query to populate the new tables.  This should probably be at night, or whenever activity is low.  And the data in that table, of course, will never exactly be up to date.
[Yet another edit]  Don't forget that the new tables you create need to be indexed too!  The good part is that you can index to your heart's content and not worry about update lock contention, since aside from your bulk insert the table will only see selects.

There are three reasons why a sealed class is better than an unsealed class:

Versioning: When a class is originally sealed, it can change to unsealed in the future without breaking compatibility. (â¦)
Performance: (â¦) if the JIT compiler sees a call to a virtual method using a sealed types, the JIT compiler can produce more efficient code by calling the method non-virtually.(â¦)
Security and Predictability: A class must protect its own state and not allow itself to ever become corrupted. When a class is unsealed, a derived class can access and manipulate the base classâs state if any data fields or methods that internally manipulate fields are accessible and not private.(â¦)

When a test fails, it should be immediately obvious where the problem lies.  If you have to use the debugger to track down the problem, then your tests aren't granular enough.  Having exactly one assertion per test helps here.
When you refactor, no tests should fail.
Tests should run so fast that you never hesitate to run them.
All tests should pass always; no non-deterministic results.
Unit tests should be well-factored, just like your production code.

@Alotor: If you're suggesting that a library should only have unit tests at its external API, I disagree.  I want unit tests for each class, including classes that I don't expose to external callers.  (However, if I feel the need to write tests for private methods, then I need to refactor.)

EDIT: There was a comment about duplication caused by ""one assertion per test"".  Specifically, if you have some code to set up a scenario, and then want to make multiple assertions about it, but only have one assertion per test, you might duplication the setup across multiple tests.
I don't take that approach.  Instead, I use test fixtures per scenario.  Here's a rough example:

Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

When I first read about LSP, I assumed that this was meant in a very strict sense, essentially equating it to interface implementation and type-safe casting.  Which would mean that LSP is either ensured or not by the language itself.  For example, in this strict sense, ThreeDBoard is certainly substitutable for Board, as far as the compiler is concerned.
After reading up more on the concept though I found that LSP is generally interpreted more broadly than that.
In short, what it means for client code to ""know"" that the object behind the pointer is of a derived type rather than the pointer type is not restricted to type-safety.  Adherence to LSP is also testable through probing the objects actual behavior.  That is, examining the impact of an object's state and method arguments on the results of the method calls, or the types of exceptions thrown from the object.
Going back to the example again, in theory the Board methods can be made to work just fine on ThreeDBoard.  In practice however, it will be very difficult to prevent differences in behavior that client may not handle properly, without hobbling the functionality that ThreeDBoard is intended to add.
With this knowledge in hand, evaluating LSP adherence can be a great tool in determining when composition is the more appropriate mechanism for extending existing functionality, rather than inheritance.

So suppose you're in a situation where you want to update an object and then return its current value.
instead of saying 
myObj.Update();
var val = myObj.GetCurrentValue();

you will be able to combine the two lines to say
var val = myObj.Update().GetCurrentValue();

On a related note, what do you guys think of having the language include a new bit of syntactic sugar:
var val = myObj.Update()<.GetCurrentValue();

This operator would have a low order of precedence so myObj.Update() would execute first and then call  GetCurrentValue() on myObj instead of the void return of Update.

Recently, I have been confronted to the problem and after several unsuccessful trials and experimentations, I came finally with two viable solutions:

Write your own printing DLL using the Win32 API (in C/C++ for instance), then use it from your service with P/Invoke (works fine)
Write your own printing COM+ component, then uses it from your service. I have chosen this solution with success recently (but it was third party COM+ component, not own written) It works absolutely fine too.

Issues with that are:

Multi-page printing will be a big headache.
Still have to use PrintDocument to print the memory stream, which is unsupported in a Windows Service (though it may work - haven't gotten that far with the prototype yet)

The problem is, that the used ICU version is far outdated right now. So I replaced the icu.jar file with ICU4J version 3.2. Now ProGuard finds a bunch of other errors/warnings about incosistencies with the libraries of JRST.

As you can see, it is somewhat desirable to not need to do this manually.
So far I've only tried AutoJar and ProGuard, both of which were fairly easy to get running. It appears that there's some issue with the constant pool in the JAR files.
Apparently jrst is slightly broken, so I'll make a go of fixing it. The Maven pom.xml file was apparently broken too, so I'll have to fix that before fixing jrst ... I feel like a bug-magnet :-)

Update: I never got around to fixing this application, but I checked out Eclipse's ""Runnable JAR export wizard"" which is based on a fat JAR. I found this very easy to use for deploying my own code.
Some of the other excellent suggestions might be better for builds in a non-Eclipse environment, oss probably should make a nice build using Ant. (Maven, so far has just given me pain, but others love it.)

To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations.
This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.
My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?

We do use LabVIEW and I have checked the LAVA forums and there are a number of interesting examples. This is part of our test software and we are trying to avoid using too many non-standard VI libraries so I was hoping for feedback on the process/algorithms involved rather than specific code.

$schedule[""A""][""Spring""]='tTS';
$schedule[""A""][""Summer""]='Any';

A DBA has no freedom to make changes

I really don't see this as being a benefit. Being able to change something in isolation might sound good in theory, but just because the changes fulfil a contract doesn't mean it's returning the correct results. To be able to determine what the correct results are you need context and you get that context from the calling code.

I'd really prefer an existing tool or project (I'll buy!).
Requirements:

One-time migration only
Full history with comments

Optional:

Some support for labels/branches/tags
Relatively speedy. It can take hours but not days.
Cost if available

Bonus points if you can share personal experience related to this process.

One of the reasons I'd like to do this is because we have lots of projects spread between Vault and Subversion (we're finally away from sourcesafe). It'd be helpful in some situations to be able to consolidate a particular customer's repos to SVN.
Additionally, SVN is better supported among third party tools. For example, Hudson and Redmine.
Again, though: we're not abandoning vault altogether.

Change the index to nonclustered, and leave it as a heap table, without a clustered index
Change the index to nonclustered, but then add a surrogate key (like ""id"") and make it an identity, primary key, and clustered index

Either one will speed up your inserts without noticeably slowing down your reads. 
Think about it this way -- right now, you're telling SQL to do a bulk insert, but then you're asking SQL to reorder the entire table every table you add anything. With a nonclustered index, you'll add the records in whatever order they come in, and then build a separate index indicating their desired order. 
",24200,1948.0,2008-08-23T12:53:09Z,,50,What's the fastest way to bulk insert a lot of data in SQL Server (C# client),"I am hitting some performance bottlenecks with my C# client inserting bulk data into a SQL Server 2005 database and I'm looking for ways in which to speed up the process.
I am already using the SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy (which is based on TDS) to speed up the data transfer across the wire which helped a lot, but I'm still looking for more.
I have a simple table that looks like this: 
 CREATE TABLE [BulkData](
 [ContainerId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [BinId] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Sequence] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [ItemId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [Left] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Top] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Right] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Bottom] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PKBulkData] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
 (
  [ContainerIdId] ASC,
  [BinId] ASC,
  [Sequence] ASC
))

I'm inserting data in chunks that average about 300 rows where ContainerId and BinId are constant in each chunk and the Sequence value is 0-n and the values are pre-sorted based on the primary key.  
The %Disk time performance counter spends a lot of time at 100% so it is clear that disk IO is the main issue but the speeds I'm getting are several orders of magnitude below a raw file copy.
Does it help any if I:

Drop the Primary key while I am doing the inserting and recreate it later
Do inserts into a temporary table with the same schema and periodically transfer them into the main table to keep the size of the table where insertions are happening small
Anything else?

--
Based on the responses I have gotten, let me clarify a little bit:
Portman: I'm using a clustered index because when the data is all imported I will need to access data sequentially in that order.  I don't particularly need the index to be there while importing the data.  Is there any advantage to having a nonclustered PK index while doing the inserts as opposed to dropping the constraint entirely for import?
Chopeen:  The data is being generated remotely on many other machines (my SQL server can only handle about 10 currently, but I would love to be able to add more).  It's not practical to run the entire process on the local machine because it would then have to process 50 times as much input data to generate the output.
Jason: I am not doing any concurrent queries against the table during the import process, I will try dropping the primary key and see if that helps.

Murakami is interesting in that he takes very recognizable situations and twists them around, turns them on their head and spits them back out. And sometimes that is just what we need.

for humans, so they can easily see your intent
for the computer, so a program that might compare or otherwise process your table can query the database for the table's primary key.

A primary key doesn't have to be an auto-incrementing number field, so I would say that it's a good idea to specify your guid column as the primary key.",5600,615.0,2008-08-08T02:47:15Z,,37,Tables with no Primary Key,"I have several tables whose only unique data is a uniqueidentifier (a Guid) column. Because guids are non-sequential (and they're client-side generated so I can't use newsequentialid()), I have made a non-primary, non-clustered index on this ID field rather than giving the tables a clustered primary key.
I'm wondering what the performance implications are for this approach. I've seen some people suggest that tables should have an auto-incrementing (""identity"") int as a clustered primary key even if it doesn't have any meaning, as it means that the database engine itself can use that value to quickly look up a row instead of having to use a bookmark.
My database is merge-replicated across a bunch of servers, so I've shied away from identity int columns as they're a bit hairy to get right in replication.
What are your thoughts? Should tables have primary keys? Or is it ok to not have any clustered indexes if there are no sensible columns to index that way?

To summarize my arguments against the common complaints:
Clean-up is invisible to users; we need to add new features.
The bugs constantly produced by messy code are visible to users too. Time spent fixing those bugs could have been spent adding features. The longer we stay in quality debt, the more time it takes to add each new feature.
We don't have time for clean-up.
You'd rather spend your time fixing bugs generated by the problem rather than fixing the problem? That's like whacking weeds every weekend instead of pulling them up by the roots. Prevention is sixteen times more valuable than cure.
Developers got themselves into this mess; they should get themselves out of it on their own time.
Had developers not gotten releases out the door as fast as they did, had they not responded so swiftly to early adopter feedback, even when the product morphed into a beast quite different from its original conception, we wouldn't have our current customers and revenue. We'd be working for another company, not complaining about the software we built.
Attention CEO's: Finger-pointing impedes resolution. Instead, challenge your developers to reduce bug reports. This is easily measured, so you can track time versus results. Remember, developers prefer implementing new features to fixing bugs, so if they're begging for time to fix bugs, it's serious.

Firefox3 saves its bookmarks and history in an SQLite database
Every time you load a page it writes to this database several times
SQLite cares deeply that you don't lose your bookmarks, so each time it writes, instructs the kernel to flush it's database file to disk and ensure that it's fully written

Like others have mentioned, SQL is great for operations and modifications on sets of data. Anybody who has done extensive large application development with complex business/domain rules would likely tell you - trying to enforce some of these rules using pure SQL (some times into a single macro query) can get truly nightmarish.
There are just certain tasks that are better handled in a procedural or OO fashion. By having the choice of using .NET code to break down the sequence of logic, query operations can get easier to read and debug. Having used CLR stored procs I can tell you stepping through with the debugger really makes it easier to follow through with what is happening at the database level.
Just one example, we frequently use CLR stored procs here as a ""gateway"" for dynamic search queries. Say a search request that can have up to 30 different search parameters. Users obviously don't use all 30 of them, so the data structure passed in will have 30 parameters but mostly DBNULL. The client side has no option to generate a dynamic statement, for obvious security reasons. The resulting dynamic statement is generated internally without fear of external ""extras"".

63406,,2008-09-15T14:28:59Z,63100,7,"In general testers and documenters (and other non-developes)  are all equal members of a scrum team. The idea behind that is to minimize risk. 
Requiring a definition of done, which includes a potentially shipable product that's fully tested and documented, forces the project to come together at the end of each sprint.
If testing does not start until AFTER dev. is done, what happens is that a lot of bugs are discovered after the developers are done with a task. So now you have to fix those bugs, and that's very slow and expensive both because bugs interact and because the general rule is: ""The expense of fixing a bug grows exponentially with time.""  Bugs you catch early are cheap and easy to fix, late bugs are a nightmare.
That is why you want testing (and documentation) to move in step with development. And right now you should be asking, how! Testing is slow, how the heck can it move in step with dev? 
The answer is automation, that is SCRUM always sits on top of XP or Agile, both demand excellent unit test coverage and TDD. Here's another gotcha to watch out for. The features developers should be the ones writing both, unit and system test. All testing automation should be done by the feature dev. team. Some places split feature dev. from automation dev. and that's bad.
OK, so now you have great automated testing and you run it AT LEAST once a day. And obviously you practice continuous integration right? This reduces the work load of the testers by a huge amount. And that's how testing can stay in step with dev. One more thing, the testers now work on the really hard and creative stuff that's impossible or very difficult to automate, every time they find a bug that way, what ever it took to expose the bug is automated and becomes part of the daily regression tests. Phew, that's a long answer!
Now to the second part of your question. Scrum is about discipline.  Sprints are short and backlog changes during a sprint should NOT happen. Non technical work should be branched of onto a customer support team and they can do Scrum around that. You're right when you say that is sounds like your culture and practices are incompatible with scrum.
In my experience transitioning to Scrum/Agile is a very painful, stressful process and most attempts to transition fail. One of the key's to success is a champion for Scrum/Agile in the executive team. From your description it sounds like you don't have one.  
There are costs and benefits to Scrum, but you're doing it badly you might be incurring costs with little or no benefit.  If you're doing Scrum wrong and badly, you might be better off not doing Scrum at all.

First, what should be the role of testers, designers and non-developers as a whole in the Scrum process?
If they are equal to other team members a couple of issues arise. Designers and testers usually work on a task after development is done, so they cannot adequately plan for a sprint because of this dependency.  
Second, we have deadlines. These are strict and have a lot of impact on prioritization. The end result is backlog changes in the middle of a sprint because of deadline changes, or bad results in the end of the sprint.
We also have a lot of non-technical work like customer support that has to be done in the meantime and cannot be planned as it varies a lot.

However, there are many subtleties in this field, one of which is that locked blocks of code are automatically marked as critical regions by the Common Language Runtime.
The effect of code being marked as critical is that, if the entire region cannot be entirely executed, the runtime may consider that your entire Application Domain is potentially jeopardized and, therefore, unload it from memory. To quote MSDN:

For example, consider a task that attempts to allocate memory while holding a lock. If the memory allocation fails, aborting the current task is not sufficient to ensure stability of the AppDomain, because there can be other tasks in the domain waiting for the same lock. If the current task is terminated, other tasks could be deadlocked.

Therefore, even though your application is single-threaded, this may be a hazard for you. Consider that one method in a locked block throws an exception that is eventually not handled within the block. Even if the exception is dealt as it bubbles up through the call stack, your critical region of code didn't finish normally. And who knows how the CLR will react?

However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields.
Taking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.
The first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields.
E.g
public class User
{
	private string name;
	private AccountStatus status;

	private User()
	{
	}

	public string Name
	{
		get { return name; }
		set { name = value; }
	}

	public AccountStatus Status
	{
		get { return status; }
	}

	public void Activate()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Active;
	}

	public void Suspend()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Suspended;
	}

	public static User GetById(int id)
	{
		User fetchedUser = new User();

		// Lots of database and error-checking code
		// omitted for clarity
		// ...

		fetchedUser.name = (string) reader[""Name""];
		fetchedUser.status = (int)reader[""statusCode""] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active;

		return fetchedUser;
	}

	public static void Save(User user)
	{
		// Code to save User's internal structure to database
		// ...
	}
}

In this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields.
The second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:
  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts)
  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally
  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++
For more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture'
However, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably.
",9240,1144.0,2008-08-12T21:06:38Z,,10,Interfaces on different logic layers,"Say you have an application divided into 3-tiers: GUI, business logic, and data access. In your business logic layer you have described your business objects: getters, setters, accessors, and so on... you get the idea. The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. 
This great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.
But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic; now it is possible set fields from the UI layer, which the UI layer has no business setting. 
Because of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data. Thus, the interface does not guarantee safe usage anymore.
I hope I explained the problem clearly enough. How do you prevent interface eroding, maintain information hiding and encapsulation, and yet still accommodate different interface needs among different layers?

If your use-cases never require updates to both databases within the same transaction, then you can use two JpaTransactionManagers, but I'm not sure you will be able to use the @Transactional approach? In this case, you would need to fallback on the older mechanism of using a simple TransactionProxyFactoryBean to define transaction boundaries, eg:
<bean id=""firstRealService"" class=""com.acme.FirstServiceImpl""/>
<bean id=""firstService""  
    class=""org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean"">
    <property name=""transactionManager"" ref=""firstJpaTm""/>

           <prop key=""update*"">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
           <prop key=""*"">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly</prop>
        </props>
    </property>
</bean>
<!-- similar for your second service -->

If you are require a transaction spanning both databases, then you will need to use a JTA transaction manager. The API states:

This transaction manager is appropriate for applications that use a single JPA EntityManagerFactory for transactional data access. JTA (usually through JtaTransactionManager) is necessary for accessing multiple transactional resources within the same transaction. Note that you need to configure your JPA provider accordingly in order to make it participate in JTA transactions.

What this means is that you will need to provide a JTA transaction manager. In our application, we use config similar to the following:
<tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager=""txManager""/>

<bean id=""txManager"" 
    class=""org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager"">
    <property name=""transactionManagerName"" value=""appserver/jndi/path"" />
</bean>

If you are deploying within an appserver, then the spring JtaTransactionManager needs to do a lookup to the real XA-compliant JTA transaction manager provided by the appserver. However, you can also use a standalone JTA transaction manager (but I haven't tried this myself yet)
As for configuring the Jpa persistence provider, I'm not that familiar. What JPA persistence provider are you using?
The code above is based on our approach, where we were using native Hibernate as opposed to Hibernate's JPA implementation.

He instinctively sees no issues with this, while I only see an endless series of problems and degradations.  Once I start talking to him about the complexity of our platform, and more in depth specifics of byte code, JVMs, libraries, differences between operating systems, processor architectures, etc...well...his eyes glaze over, he smiles and he has made it clear he thinks I'm being childishly resistive.
Why does he want a single magic executable?  He sees a couple of ""benefits"":

If it is a binary executable, then it is hard to reverse engineer and circumvent any licensing.  Management lives in constant fear that this is happening, even though we sell into larger corporates who generally do not do cheat with server software.  
There is that vision of downloading this magic executable, running it, and everything works. (No more sending me out to do customer installations, which is not that frequent.)

So, I've done my obligatory 20 minutes of googling, and now I am here.

Java 6 (Sun's JVM)
AspectJ 1.6
Tomcat 6
Hibernate 3
Spring 2
another two dozen supporting jar files

What it does

A streaming media CMS
Performance sensitive
Deployed on Linux, Solaris, Windows (and developed on a Mac)

As you can probably gather, I'm highly skeptical of this ""compiling Java to native code"" thing.  It sound like where Mono (VB on Linux) was back in 2000.  But am I being overly pessimistic?  Is it viable?  Should I actually spend the time (days if not weeks) to try this out?

47932,2958.0,2008-09-06T23:04:23Z,30710,6,"I can perhaps give you a taste of our experience when we began looking at unit testing our middle-tier process that included a ton of ""business logic"" sql operations.
We first created an abstraction layer that allowed us to ""slot in"" any reasonable database connection (in our case, we simply supported a single ODBC-type connection).
Once this was in place, we were then able to do something like this in our code (we work in C++, but I'm sure you get the idea):
GetDatabase().ExecuteSQL( ""INSERT INTO foo ( blah, blah )"" )
At normal run time, GetDatabase() would return an object that fed all our sql (including queries), via ODBC directly to the database.
We then started looking at in-memory databases - the best by a long way seems to be SQLite. (http://www.sqlite.org/index.html).  It's remarkably simple to set up and use, and allowed us subclass and override GetDatabase() to forward sql to an in-memory database that was created and destroyed for every test performed.
We're still in the early stages of this, but it's looking good so far, however we do have to make sure we create any tables that are required and populate them with test data - however we've reduced the workload somewhat here by creating a generic set of helper functions that can do a lot of all this for us.
Overall, it has helped immensely with our TDD process, since making what seems like quite innocuous changes to fix certain bugs can have quite strange affects on other (difficult to detect) areas of your system - due to the very nature of sql/databases.
Obviously, our experiences have centred around a C++ development environment, however I'm sure you could perhaps get something similar working under PHP/Python.
Hope this helps.

So will it be better and easier if I commit this in a version control database?
Basically I want to keep different version of a file.

What have I learn from answers:

Use Time Machine to save different
version (or Shadow copy in Vista)
There is a difference between text
and binary documents when you use
version control app. (I didn't know
that)
Diff won't work on binary files
A notification system (ie email) for revision is great

Update : 
I played around with Google Docs revision feature and feel that it is almost right for me. Just a bit annoyed with the too frequent versioning (autosaving).

Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.
Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).
Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).
And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.
Now, i hear a lot of great stuff about the Red Gate products, but for hobby projects, the price is a bit steep.

@Linor: That's essentially what you would do after creating a Voronoi diagram. But instead of making a rectangular grid, you can choose dividing lines that closely match the lines of the Voronoi diagram (this way you will get fewer areas that cross dividing lines). If you recursively divide your Voronoi diagram in half along the best dividing line for each subdiagram, you can then do a tree search for each point you want to look up.

It's pretty simple though once you understand the concepts and all the dependencies are handled automatically.  I should note that we use Visual Studio project files, which have a lot of logic built into them, but this system allows people to build almost identically both within the Visual Studio IDE or at the command line and still gives you the flexibility of adding things to the canonical build like the xUnit testing you see in the script above.
The one PropertyGroup is where all the configuration happens and things can be customized, like excluding certain projects from the build or adding new test assembly masks.
The ItemGroup is where the logic happens that finds all the .csproj files in the tree.
Then there are the targets, which most people familiar with make, nAnt or MSBuild should be able to follow.  If you call the Build target, it calls _Compile, _Deploy and __Test.  The Clean target calls MSBuild on all the project files for them to clean up their directories and then the global deployment directory is deleted.  Rebuild calls Clean and then Build.

But to the extent that OOP has been a waste of time, I'd say it's because of lack of programmer training, compounded by the steep learning curve of learning a language specific OOP mapping. Some people ""get"" OOP and others never will.

I dunno if that's really surprising, though.  I think that technically sound approaches (LSP being the obvious thing) make hard to use, but if we don't use such approaches it makes the code brittle and inextensible anyway (because we can no longer reason about it).  And I think the counterintuitive results that OOP leads us to makes it unsurprising that people don't pick it up.
More significantly, since software is already fundamentally too hard for normal humans to write reliably and accurately, should we really be extolling a technique that is consistently taught poorly and appears hard to learn? If the benefits were clear-cut then it might be worth persevering in spite of the difficulty, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.
I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.
In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).

Nothing's perfect
BUT as Anders pointed out, those metrics are based on the system font. If your window uses a shell dialog font or simply anything not making your eyes bleed, you're pretty much on your own.
To get your own ""dialog"" base units, you have to retrieve current text metrics with GetTextMetrics() and use character height and average width (tmHeight and tmAveCharWidth of the TEXTMETRIC struct respectively) and translate them with MulDiv by your own, unless you are in a dialog, then MapDialogRect() will do all the job for you.
Note that tmAveCharWidth only approximates the actual average character width so it's recommended to use a GetTextExtentPoint32() function on an alphabetic character set instead.
See:

How to calculate dialog box units based on the current font in Visual C++

Simpler alternative
If buttons are the only control you want to resize automatically, you can also use BCM_GETIDEALSIZE message Button_GetIdealSize() macro (Windows XP and up only) to retrieve optimal width and height that fits anything the button contains, though it looks pretty ugly without any margins applied around the button's text.

I was thinking about a comment from Kristopher Johnson about my answer to this question regarding Software Development Quality.
I'd posted a list of software quality metrics that I could think of off the top of my head that included:

McCabe Cyclometric Complexity - basically a measure of the number of linear paths through code.
Levels of indentation - a measure of complexity when looking at nested decision statements.
Distance from declaration to first use - how many statements exist between where a variable is declared and where it is first used.
Comment percentage - how many lines of code are comments compared to source code.
Percent test coverage - as a percentage of lines of code, how many are exercised by your suite of tests.
Path test coverage - how many paths of execution are exercised by your tests.
Unit coverage - how many individual units, classes, packages, etc., are exercised by your unit tests.

Kris's comment was:

Only the test-coverage metrics listed here could be considered a measure of ""quality."" The others are measurements of complexity and readability, which really has nothing to do with quality.

Apart from the fact that I don't agree with this statement at all, it got me thinking.
When I have to review code that has hardly any associated tests, whether unit, system or integration, I tend to approach the code much, much more warily than if I see a good suite of tests that have been successfully passed.
Same thing when performing security audits on code. If I see unused variables, huge functions, bizarre mixtures of configs, per server, per dir, etc. being used in Apache modules it also predisposes me to approach the code very warily.
Does anyone else use this initial ""gut feeling"" approach and does it affect the outcome?
BTW I don't agree with Kris's comment because all the other metrics are definitely valid measures that will help highlight badly designed, poorly executed code. As Damian Conway says:

Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.

The downside of that is that current preferred coding approaches continue to evolve at a fairly hurried clip â but for the last couple of versions, there has been strong emphasis on API compatibility, so the burden is now mostly mental rather than administrative.

I have seen nothing like it in all of web-framework-dom, and it is a most excellent tool to keep your code as DRY as possible. This couples well with another great thing that Catalyst provides, namely uri_for â a method which takes a controller and a bunch of arguments and then constructs a URI that would dispatch to that place, which it returns. Together, these facilities mean that you can structure your URI space any way you deem right, yet at the same time can structure your controllers to avoid duplication of logic, and keep templates independent of the URI structure.

To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations.
This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.
My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?

I'm dealing with one of those 'Select an item:'-type drop-downs, in which case the first option is really a label, and an action occurs onchange(). This is fairly well 'progressively enhanced', in that a submit button is present, and only removed via javascript. If the ""select..."" option were removed, whatever then were to become the first item would not be selectable. Are we just ruling out 'onchange' drop downs altogether, or should the ""select..."" option be selectable, just with no effect?

Silverlight lacks the component model and event triggering capabilites that Flex has.  Using XNA, and C#, a friend of mine has to jump through all kinds of hoops to get his Silverlight application to work.  Then, it has to be handed off to a designer to get it to look half way decent.  
Listen to the deepfriedbytes.com podcasts on Silverlight, and you'll hear how even a couple guys that really push Silverlight, acknowledge some of these issues.  (I think, if I recall correctly, one of the guys works for Microsoft, but I could be wrong - I listened to it last week).  They agree that Silverlight isn't quite ready for any huge applications, in its current state.
I would go with Flex, for a nice clean, straightforward approach - especially if you're already familiar with Flash and ActionScript 3.0.  Flex makes alot more sense, in my opinion - Silverlight still has to mature.

Most of our other development is done using .NET.  I'm trying to make a push towards doing Silverlight development instead, since it would take better advantage of the .NET developers on staff.  I prefer the Silverlight platform over the Flex platform for the simple fact that Silverlight is all .NET code.  We have more .NET developers on staff than Flash/Flex developers, and most of our Flash/Flex developers are graphic artists (not real programmers).  Only reason they push towards Flex right now is because it seems like the logical step from Flash.
I've done development using both, and I honestly believe Silverlight is easier to work with.  But I'm trying to convince people who are only Flash developers. 
So here's my question:  If I'm going to go into a meeting to praise Silverlight, why would a company want to go with Silverlight instead of Flex?  Other than the obvious ""not everyone has Silverlight"", what are the pros and cons for each?

50679,5274.0,2008-09-08T21:01:54Z,50650,6,"Well I think the problem is you are say ""all functions"". All functions don't need unit tests, and some would argue that unit testing individual functions at all is down-right wrong in many scenarios.
Instead, I recommend unit testing actual ""units of functionality"". Instead of writing a single test for each function, write a test for each scenario or feature. Besides saving you lots of time and allowing you to slip in the tests in under the radar, it is often far more accurate because it literally tests the functions they way they are being used. Too often function by function unit tests don't test the right thing, or even worse, test mocks. 
I recommend you avoid using mocks in testing at all costs. The use of a mock essentially invalidates the test because you are testing how it works in idealized circumstances instead of how it works in the real world.
A side benefit is that you also get better dead-code detection. Any code that isn't covered by a high level test probably isn't being used and can be removed. Never underestimate the value of eliminating dead code.

But as you already have a working C# code, porting it to ActionScript might requires a redesign due to ActionScript having a different way of thinking/programming, they use different primitive data types, for example, they use just a Number instead of int float double etc. and the debugging tools are quiet lacking compared to VS IMO.
And I heard that Mono's GtkSharp is quiet a decent platform.
But if you don't mind the coding/debugging tooling problems, then AIR is a great platform. I like how Adobe integrates the Flash experience into it e.g. you can start an installation of AIR application via a button click in a flash movieclip, that kind of integration.

Note that a parameterized query is not the same as ad hoc sql.
The main reason imo to still favor stored procedures today has more to do with security.  If you use stored procedures exclusively, you can disable INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, and CREATE etc permissions for your application's user, only leaving it with EXECUTE.  
This provides a little extra protection against 2nd order sql injection.  Parameterized queries only protect against 1st order injection.
